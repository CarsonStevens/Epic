Angel of Light, was cast from God's grace,

But once every thousand years, when the

prison seeking vengeance against Han. Zf he

A woman lies in stirrups, breathing rhythmically. Her husband







squeezes her hand while the obstetrician kneels between her

Push... that's it. Push.

The Bead Priest opens a box and removes a snake. Be holds the







snake high, showing it to the others. Then he takes a silver

EXT. VATICAN CITY - NIGHT







The majestic towers of the Vatican rise high into the night,







their shadowy faces lit from the glow of street lamps below.







The moon, not yet full, hangs low in the sky. But something's







different. Above the moon is a FAINT ARC of some kind.







In the window of one of the tower rooms, candle light







flickers and a shadow moves across the pane of glass.







INT. ROOM - NIGHT







Monastieally spare - a wooden chair, table and bed. Open on







the table is an ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPT. Beautiful lettering







adorns its worn parchment pages, and a rich illustration







leaps off the opposing page. The shadow moves across the







page. A Monk takes his seat at the table.







MONK







All my life have I watched the skies,







waiting for the sign.







The monk points to the illustration in the manuscript. The







full moon hangs low in the sky. Across the top of the moon is







a comet, its tail sweeping in an arc over the glowing orb.







The effect is that of a giant eye. Beneath it, a child lies







inside a Pentagram.

Another SHADOW moves in the candle lit roam. His vestments







rustle as he moves to the window balcony, stepping out into







the night air. Above him in the sky, THE VERY SAME SIGN. A







comet arcing over the moon.

Your Holiness, there can be no doubt.

Oh, shit.

Jericho stirs. Chicago helps him to his feet.







Jericho pulls off his jacket. Beneath it... A Kevlar vest







with four bullets imbedded in its surface.







JERICHO

Jericho and Chicago race toward the descending helicopter.







They don't break stride as they jump on the hood, then roof







of an NYPD patrol car, surprising the hell out of the officer







inside. The helicopter doesn't even touch down as Jericho and







Chicago climb onboard. It lifts off immediately.







EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY







The Shooter holds position behind the soaffolding rails

at the HELICOPTERS flying around him.







INT. HELICOPTER - DAY







Jericho and Chicago look out the side window, down at the







Shooter. The Shooter swings his rifle toward them and FXRES.







The glass on the WINDOW EXPLODES as it's hit by a round.







Jericho and Chicago pull out their sidearms, lean out the







broken window and FIRE at the shooter. The Shooter snakes







back into the girdirons.

EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY







The Shooter aims at the helicopter and squeezes off a FEW







ROUNDS. But Jericho'8 RETURN FIRE forces him into the open.







The Shooter fires again, but he's out of ammo. He runs, but...







The HELICOPTER descends in front of him, cutting him off.







Nowhere to go. The Shooter checks his options, glancing at







the edge of the building. As Jericho exits the helicopter,







gun drawn, the Shooter turns tail and runs toward the edge of







the building.







JERICHO jumps back onto the skid of the chopper. He yells to

stands, perched on the skid, his arm outstretched, ready to







grab the Shooter.







The Shooter's not letting up, running as fast as he can







toward oblivion. The helicopter closes on him quickly.







Jericho reaches out -his arm, just a few feet away from the

the SHOOTER by the scruff of his shirt.

he can do...

HE DOES.







THE SHOOTER PLUMMETS, continuing to fire.







Jericho can't believe what he's just done. Chicago pulls him

accelerates toward mid-town.

EXT. STREET - DAY







A CABBIE watches through his window as the Shooter glides







down the block toward him.







When he's about ten feet from the ground, the Shooter cuts







his chute. He plummets onto the roof of the cab.

Bey! Asshole. You better have

The Shooter leapfrogs acros.s cars toward a subway entrance.







As the Cabbie turns back around, he sees a helicopter descend







on him. Jericho poised at the door. As soon as the helicopter







is close enough to the ground, JERICHO JUMPS... hits the top







of a bus. Be sees the Shooter disappear into the dark hole of







the subway.







Be climbs down the side of the bus.







INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - DAY







Against the protesting shouts of an MTA worker, Jericho jumps







the turnstile, his gun drawn. Be races through the crowded







subway platform pushing commuters aside.







As he gets to the platform's edge, he sees the Shooter

e

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAY

A hush falls on the tunnel. He hears whispers all around him.







VOICES







Jericho... Jericho....







The sharp SNAP of TWO GUNSHOTS sends him diving for cover. He







blindly returns fire down the tunnel. He listens a moment and







steps back into the open, moving stealthily, like a cat.







As he edges down the tunnel, the walls begin to glow with A







DEEP ROCKING CRIMSON and then slowly OOZE INTO FLAME.







The length of the tunnel becomes an abyss of swirling fire







and DESPERATE CRIES OF PAIN ring in our ears. The Shooter







steps into the open and turns toward Jericho, his face BLACK







AS SOOT, his eyes BURNING RED. His dark voice bellows over







the roar of the flame.

Heed me, Jericho. The thousand years

Suddenly the tunnel GOES DARK.







The Shooter screams and falls to the ground. Everything's







back to normal, except Jericho has blown two holes in the







Shooter's left leg. Jericho looks around, looking for the







light show, wondering what the hell it was.







Footsteps behind him. Chicago and the NYPD coming to the

him and reciting Miranda.

Deep echoes of rumbling thunder roll up and down the avenues.







EXT. CITY - NIGHT







A quiet block of browns tones, darkly silent on this night,







with the exception of far away flashes and distant rumblings.







The blacktop on the street SHAKES, starts to CRACK.







A terrifying rumble as the earth tears open.







A WALL OF FIRE ERUPTS FROM THE CRACK. The entire block is







swallowed by flame. Windows blow out. A GIANT TONGUE OF FIRE







reaches high up to heaven... as if hell itself had erupted.







The wall of flames swirl down the streets and in the flames







we see A SHAPE, perhaps a monstrous wing, perhaps a giant







talon stepping forward, all covered by a shroud of fire. The







shape pushes further and further out until the fire parts and







out of the fireball steps...







A HAN







Handsome, elegant, aged, yet ageless... there is something







about him that is immediately frightening.







Be looks around as if seeing the world for the very first







time. Be takes a deep breath of air, removes a silver case







from his jacket, pulls out a cigarette. Be takes a drag and







the cigarette IGNITES into a flame ON ITS OWN. The whole







block is in flames behind him, casting his long dark shadow







down the street.







From a dark alley, we see a homeless man, an ALBINO, peering







out the terrifying scene. Be turns and runs.







1ST. JERICHO'S BEDROOM - NIGHT







As THUNDER CRACKS, rattling windows, Jericho bolts straight







up in bed, breathing hard.







ANOTHER FLASH OF LIGHTNING and the first thing we notice is







.the glass. Great wide windows. Great wide sky-lights looking







up to the heavens. The city stretches around us for 360







degrees. A flash of lightning illuminates the room and we







see that the apartment is very spare. No art, minimal







furniture.

Jericho clicks the light on. We can see large welts stretch







across his chest where the bullets hit. Be checks the bruises







and when he touches one he winces.

single picture in a frame of Jericho, much younger, a woman

The storm outside intensifies and suddenly THE LIGHTS GO OUT.







DARKNESS.







A match is struck. Jericho brings the flame to light a







candle. But the candle's blown out. He lights it again. Again







it dies. He tries again, holding the match on the flame.







CRASH! Glass shatters. A rush of wind. The candle and match







blow out.







In flashes of lightning, we see that the driving winds have







blown one of his windows open. The wind billows into his room.







Another flash of lightning and he sees a WOMAN (not the one







in the picture) standing near him... ARMS OUTSTRECHED...







PLEADING.







Darkness again.







Jericho crosses to the window and pushes it shut.







Be hears SIRENS outside. Be crosses to the window, and







peering out, he sees FLAMES lick the sky a half-mile away and







hears the wailings of police and fire trucks.

disappears into the crowded New York sidewalk.







Weismann grabs at Jericho and slashes at him with his hands.







For a second the hands look different, like claws or talons

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY







The Man strides into the Sheep's Meadow. He considers the







ground, picks up some blades of grass. Smells them. He







approves. Be raises his hands and the grass begins to move.







Snakes, hundreds of them, erupt through the dirt. Sheep's







Meadow becomes a living, heaving mass.







Picnickers and Joggers scream as the reptiles twist around







their feet.







The Man murmurs some words in an ancient language and ttni*n







without warning...







THE SNAKES TRANSFORM into FIRE.







The people run in panic as the snakes join into a wall of







flames rising into the sky. Thick smoke billows upward







clouding over the sun.







A darkness settles on the city.







Then it stops. The flames disappear.







We pull up over the smoldering ground and all that is left is







a MASSIVE PENTAGRAM seared into the Earth. For a few brief







moments the earth is translucent, we can see through the dirt







WRITHING BODIES of the damned juet below the surface.

Jericho enters the cavernous cathedral. Stained glass windows

Good day.

Jericho furrows his brow. Deciding to follow Murphy, he







pushes the wooden door open and finds himself on a carved







stone landing...

INT. UNDERGROUND CHAMBER - DAY







AN OPEN ROOM the size of a football field. Hundreds of people







in religous garb are gathered around desks. Some are praying







over phone books, some are surveying maps of the city.







Father Murphy is among them. Be seems to be coordinating







activities with a number of other Religious Leaders. Jericho







takes a few more steps down and wonders at this hidden world.







Father Murphy looks up and sees Jericho at the bottom of the







steps. He motions to a couple of YOUNG MEN who make their way







over to Jericho. Jericho retreats up the steps.

Bright Crayon Drawings. A child holding a mother's hand. A







field of sun flowers. A cow next to a barn. She stops on the







next picture. UGLY, ANGRY, Black and red crayon swirls with







a crude drawing of Christine inside. Letters ere scrawled







across the drawing... "WELCOME TO BELL".







Christine looks at the drawing, upset and worried. There's no







name on it.







A homeless man stops and STARES AT HER, the same one who was

from her while the other two wrestle her to the ground. They







each take a limb as they pull her toward the bed.







They hold her face-down, spread eagle. She tries to twist

go in weapons drawn.







They see Christine, hands and feet bound, hooded, being







dragged across the carpet by the commandos. The Commandos







dive out of the way and open fire on Jericho. Jericho ducks







back in the hallway, pivoting back in every moment or so to







return fire. The Commandos race across Christine's apartment







and dive out the window bearing the fire escape, leaving







Christine bound on the floor. Jericho rushes to Christine's

Christine sits by a desk as a cop types up her report. She







looks around nervously. All the other suspects seem to be







staring at her. Most of them have red eyes. A HOOKER chews







her own flesh and leers at her, blowing her a kiss. She







closes her eyes.

Jericho fights like a man possessed, tossing bodies out of







the way, suffering blows from billy clubs. The Hooker spots







him and fires several times, Jericho dives behind a desk.







Be grabs a desk lamp and throws it at the Booker. As she







ducks, he leaps, slamming into her and knocking the gun from







her hand. The businessman grabs him, but Jericho smashes his







palms against the bridge of the man's nose, shattering it.







Jericho grabs a gun. But suddenly... everything becomes







quiet. Everyone stops fighting.







They all turn slowly and see the Man. Most of them eye him







like dogs staring at their master. As the Man walks, he







touches their outstretched hands. One cops steps in front of







him, but the Han touches him and the cop steps away.







The Man finds Christine half-hiding behind Jericho at the







opposite end of the large room. Jericho's got the gun leveled







at the Man.







Bello Christine.







Christine's face flickers with a dull red light. The Man

his arms as if to embrace his long lost love.

this moment. And you have failed. She

The Han has recovered the broken silver dagger, imbeds the







blade into the chest of the Cardinal. Be cuts out the Old







Cardinal's heart and holds it, still beating, in his hand.







The Kan bitea into the still beating heart. The Old Cardinal







screams in pain and bursts into flame.







The Church begins to collapse all around them. Jericho pulls







Christine through a door by the rear of the church and into







a stairwell.







INT. STAIRWELL - DAY







Everything rumbles. It's like trying to run down the stairs







in an Earthquake. Jericho pushes through another set of doors







revealing the underground chamber. The stairwell collapses







behind them.

They rush across the chamber as pieces of rock and plaster







tumble from the ceiling. They reach a set of doors on the far







side.







Jericho tries them. Locked.







EXT. NEW YORK CITY - STREET







The Cathedral COLLAPSES into a heap and is SWALLOWED INTO A







PIT OF FIRE. A crowd gathers staring into the pit.







INT. UNDERGROUND CHAMBER - DAY







The ground shakes and rumbles. From the stairwell a tongue of







fire shoots out at them.







A wall of fire rolls toward them. They're trapped at the end







of the chamber. With all his Blight Jericho slams against the







door. It gives. They tumble through it, just as the tongue of







flame reaches them.







INT. SEWER - DAY







The fire bursts through the doorway, but Jericho and







Christine are out of its path. They hear the mighty structure







cave in behind them.







Then all is quite. Jericho takes Christine by the hand as







they struggle through the muck.







CHRISTINE

Jericho and Christine splash through the shallow water. They







hear echoes and shouts, seemingly surrounding them. The







hounds after the foxes. Up ahead the sewer splits at a







juncture.







JERICHO







Wait a minute*







Jericho studies the two paths. Christine hears the voices and







looks around. She takes aim at the darkness with her gun.

JERICHO (cont'd)

behind them.







Dizzying shots as Jericho and Christine flee down sewage







tunnel, turning left and right... down narrow passage ways.







They hear the shouts behind them, see the dull glow of







torches and flashlights chasing them.







Christine tumbles. Jericho runs to her side. She's breathing

jump, grabbing onto Jericho's leg. He's pulled back down, but







continues climbing. People hang off of him.

Jericho rips the cowling off the steering wheel. As he

try to pull him from the car.

Jericho has been pulled halfway out of the window now.







Fighting... struggling to get back inside.

BAM. BAH. They're slammed around again. Jericho spots a lamp







post up ahead. He jockeys ahead of one of the police cars and







swings his wheel around hard. Metal grinds. The cruiser

shatter parking meter after parking meter as they race after







the Buick.







Jericho spins back onto the street at the next corner. One of







the police cars can't keep up. It takes the turn too wide end

Buick. The Buick spins out, bounces off the curb and comes to







a halt in the middle of the street. Its engine dies.

Jericho tries to re-jump the car, crossing the ignition wires.







Meanwhile, Francis doubles back in his cruiser, eyeing the







Buick which sits dead in the road like a lame duck.







Francis floors it. He going to ram the Buick. Christine sees

The Buick lurches forward. The Police cruiser hits the curb,







and bounces onto the sidewalk.







Francis spins the wheel. The cop car skids, hits the side of







a building and accelerates after the Buick.







The Buick races down the dark streets, with the police

EXT. WESTSIDE BIGBWAY - DAY

breaks to avoid bitting a mass of New Yorkers racing down the







parkway, carrying their children and clutching their meager

Christine and Jericho bail. A moment later, Francis comes







barreling up the onramp and slams into the empty Buick.







Francis pulls himself from his deployed airbag and steps out







of the wrecked police cruiser. He holds a 12 gauge shotgun







and scouts for Christine and Jericho. Christine steps out







from behind the car.

Footsteps walking above them and then walking below them.

side wall. Tables and chairs and video equipment tumble down

Then suddenly all is quiet.







A couple of the emergency lights are still lit. Dark and

But from the corner of bis eyes he sees the Man rise.







Jericho turns and opens fire with the MP-5. The rounds drive







into the Han, but still he stalks toward Jericho. Jericho







backs away, keeping up the barrage of bullets, until he and

her from Jericho's arms. It drags her to the closing gate.







CHRISTINE







Oh god, help me. Please help me.







Jericho lunges to her and grabs her hand before she crosses

JERICHO







Bold on.







Christine's feet are pulled across the threshold. Everything

Christine is eaught in a tug of war between good and evil.







SATAN







I have you now. Let go and come to me.







The suction from hell increases. Dying souls all over the







world are being sucked into the inferno screaming. All around







them the ghostly souls are pulled in creating a strong wind.







She still hangs there, as if she was hanging from a







precipice, dangling over a twenty thousand foot drop into







eternal darkness end damnation. Satan dangles in the hellfire







below clinging onto Christine. The stones are closing in







around her.

Don't let me fall. Please, don't let

You're not gonna fall. Bold on!







Satan climbs up his own tentacle, coming closer. Be reaches







out with his curled mangled fingers to grab her, but Jerieho







lifts the sword and holding Christine with one hand, he







heaves the sword end-over-end into the underworld. It slams







right into Satan's gut.







Using all his strength he fights the slipstream of evil as he







pulls Christine back through the Gates of Bell just as they







slam elosed forever. As all the stones join, sealing the

While this doomsday thriller contains many familiar trappings of







the genre, writer Marlowe is able to cleverly provide the drama







with imaginative action set-pieces and characters who're heroic







and strong, while at the same time weaving in themes of religion

SYNOPSISi















In 1975







shortly after a baby girl is born in an NYC







hospital, a nurse secretly rushes the infant to a Satanic ritual







where she's baptized in blood and "marked for darkness". When the







baby girl is returned to its mother, she's named CHRISTINE.







Today, NYC







JERICHO is an officer who works for a private







security firm. Presently he and a partner, CHICAGO, are protecting







a diplomat on his way to the UN. As the diplomat arrives at the UN







hq, a SHOOTER is spotted on a nearby roof. Jericho shoves the







diplomat aside and takes several rounds of shots in his bullet







proof vest. The diplomat is safe, and Jericho and Chicago chase







after the shooter in a helicopter. As the shooter is about to jump







from the roof, Jericho grabs him. But as the shooter then begins







to blast Jericho, he's dropped from the 'copter







and a parachute







unfurls. The shooter ducks into the subway, and Jericho gives







chase again, finally cornering the guy and cuffing him. But







the







shooter suddenly transforms into a hideous monster and tells







Jericho that he's powerless to stop the dark Angel. As the shooter







transforms back to a human form, Jericho is stunned. He wonders if







he's going nuts as the shooter is taken off to a hospital.







Meanwhile...in Hell's Kitchen, flames shoot high from a







crack in the pavement. From the flames a mysterious MAN (Satan)







appears and walks away...and an Albino man witnesses the event.







Later, Jericho does some research on the shooter and discovers







that he's not only a religious nutball but a man who was not







targeting the UN diplomat but him. Jericho wonders why HE was







being targeted! In the shooter's possession is also pictures of an







unknown woman.







That woman happens to be CHRISTINE BETHLEHEM







the same one







we saw being born in 1975 and baptized in blood. Christine is a







pre-school teacher with a sweet disposition, but lately she's been







experiencing terrifying visions that she can't explain. Satan, in







the meantime, goes to visit the shooter in his hospital room and







crucifies him to the wall. When Jericho and a detective go to







visit the shooter to ask questions they find him nearly dead.







Written in Hebrew on the shooter's body are two names







one is







Jericho and the other is Bethlehem. As the shooter dies, Jericho







realizes that he might be in danger. And he wonders who Bethlehem







is as well. Jericho pays a visit to the Church of St. John the







Divine and talks to FATHER MURPHY bout the shooter, whose name was







Thomas and who used to be a priest. Murphy is closed mouth, and







tells Jericho he wouldn't believe even if he told him.







Christine is on her way home when a homeless man approaches







and says "he's on his way". And when she gets to her apartment,







two COMMANDOS are waiting for her and try to abduct her.







Meanwhile, Jericho has managed to track the identity of







"Bethlehem" to Christine, and he and Chicago arrive just in time







to rescue her. The commandos flee. Christine is frightened, and







her roommate RACHEL offers support. Jericho puts a guard on

Christine for the night, and Chicago sets up a command post







outside. Christine wonders what's going on, and Jericho reads up







on Satanic heraldry...and he becomes aware of Satanic prophecies







about the End of Days, when Satan comes to claim a bride and take







over the world. Even the righteous will not survive. As Jericho







considers the meaning of this, Satan attacks the command post







outside Christine's place and blows it up. Chicago and the other







guards are killed. Jericho begins to drag Christine away to







safety, but her roommate Rachel then changes into a demonic beast







who tries to stop them. Jericho is forced to shoot Rachel dead.







When the cops finally arrive on the scene and see the destruction







(including the dead bodies of Chicago and the guards), they see







Rachel







in normal human form







dead from Jericho's gunshots. The







cops take Jericho to police hq and hold him and begin asking







Christine questions. But at the police hq, Satan arrives and tries







to get her. Jericho blocks him and flees with Christine into the







park







and they're chased by red-eyed minions of the devil. They







finally arrive at St. John the Divine Cathedral. Father Murphy is







there tp help them hide, and he tells them of the coming of







darkness and that Satan is looking for a bride...the signal of







doom. But Father Murphy claims the bible tells of a PROTECTOR, of







great faith and virtue, who comes forth to safeguard and defend







the chosen woman. Jericho claims he's couldn't possibly be the







protector if he's someone of great faith and virtue.







'(















Meanwhile... in the city chaos begins to reign. People begin







to riot and loot stores. As Jericho tries to secretly return to







his apartment, he's confronted by Satan who wants him to reveal







where Christine is hiding. Satan offers Jericho anything he wants







for this information...but Jericho refuses. Satan then tries to







throw Jericho to his death, but Jericho manages to grab Satan and







toss him to the street below. As Satan impacts on the pavement a







huge crater is made. It doesn't seem as if anything could survive







this fall, but Satan picks himself up and leaves. Jericho is then







approached by Chicago who claims he's not dead but alive; Chicago







wants to get out of the crazy city. Jericho isn't sure if Chicago







is a trick or not. Back at the cathedral, meanwhile, a Cardinal







decides to sacrifice Christine to prevent the devil from getting







her. But Jericho arrives and to protect and save her. And at the







same time Satan arrives and begins to entrance Christine. A fight







erupts between Jericho and Satan and the cathedral begins to







collapse into a pile. As Jericho and Christine are dragged into a







pit, they get away and escape into the city sewers. Christine and







Jericho are chased by not only the devil but his red-eyed







followers. Christine wants to get Satan out of her mind







he seems







to have entranced her.







Jericho and Christine escape the sewer, finding the city in







total chaos. The get into a car and are chased once again. As they







try to flee the city, the find that bridges and tunnels are







destroyed. They finally escape into an underground garage where

Satan then confronts Christine again, and she must try to resist

Jericho slips away and goes to an







armory where he drags out weapons and begins to attack Satan and







his new establishment. A huge battle erupts, and Satan claims he







canNOT be destroyed. Jericho is seen kneeling and praying







and







asking for help. Jericho then finds a Sword of Faith, and with it







he attacks Satan, now transformed into a beast. At the same time







Christine turns her back to Satan and renounces him. As the battle







rages on, Jericho is finally able to destroy Satan (at least for







now), and he caries Christine away from the scene in his







arms







just as the fire department and cops arrive to take over.

COMMENTS I















Marlowe has created an imaginative, exciting and very dynamic







supernatural thriller. While it contains some of the predictable







beats of a doomsday tale with a fairly static Satan figure







threatening to destroy the world, the battles that erupt between







the heroic security officer and the demonic forces are nicely







conceived and full of resourceful and inventive special effects.







The piece is, after all, special effects driven with NYC taking







the brunt of all the destruction and mayhem. Not only is there







chaos in the streets of the city as Satan and his minions try to







establish a foothold, but buildings collapse, others are pulled







from the underground andfifireand brimstonei makes its presence







known







on a very large scale. The heart and soul, so to speak,







of the drama lies in the characters of the heroic security officer







who becomes the iProtectorl of the woman chosen by Satan to be his







wife. This character goes up against some of the most incredible







obstacles imaginable demons, burning buildings, zombies, quakes,







. etc.







and still manages to stand on his two feet. Touchingly, he







seems to succumb to the power of Satan and momentarily become one







of his minions, but this turns out to be only a trick to get







closer to the devil and destroy him—which he does in blazing







glory. And speaking of glory—the material also is not afraid to







bring up questions of faith and virtue; the heroic security







officer is not afraid to finally ask for help from God, and it is







in these final moments when he accepts God and renounces Satan







that the script has its most powerful emotional impact. The script







winds up succeeding on a couple of levels







the truly physical,







action driven one, and the more sensitive, holy one. The script







isnit entirely perfect, though. We wonder why the heroic officer,







Jericho, was targeted for destruction from the beginning







before







he even meets Satanis intended wife; and if this is the case, we







wonder why Satan canit simply remove Jericho as an obstacle. As a







result of many similar questions the script seems, from time to







time, to be overly manipulated and contrived. But the action







sequences seem to distract us from this, and the energy never







subsides. We also wonder why Satan canit just pick any woman he







wants as a wife, not necessarily one who had to be ebaptized in







bloodi 25 years earlier. Be that as it may, the script is dynamic







and offers both action and food for religious thought.
