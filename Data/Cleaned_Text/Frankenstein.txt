The Creature finally collapses,     sliding down Victor's legs, curling up like a fetus,     twitching and jerking in its own afterbirth.          Silence now.          A ghastly tableau: Victor stands in the middle of his ruined     lab with his creation moaning and twitching at his feet in a     dying heap. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING silently bathes the room,
