As a child I was deeply concerned in tales of spooks,haunted houses, wraiths and specters and stories of weird experiences,clanking chains, ghostly sights and gruesome sounds always held mespellbound and breathless.
[W BOB HOLLAND][PERSPECTIVE]Experiences in editorial offices taught me that I was not alone inliking stories of mystery. The desire to know something of thatexistence that is veiled by Death is equally potent in old age and inyouth, and men, women and children like to be thrilled and to have a[DIALOGUE]"creepy" feeling along the spinal column as the result of reading of avisitor from beyond the grave.This volume contains the most famous of the weird stories of Edgar AllanPoe, that master of this form of literature. [DIALOGUE]"The Black Cat" containsall the needed element of mystery and supernatural, and yet the felineacts in a natural manner all of the time, and the story is quitepossibly true. It is only in the manner of its telling that the tale
[W BOB HOLLAND][GHOST]becomes one that fittingly finds its place in this collection.Guy de Maupassant, the clever Frenchman, is also represented by twoeffective bits of work, and other less widely known writers have alsocontributed stories that are worth reading, and when once read will beremembered. There is not a story among the twenty-five that is notworthy of close reading.There has recently been a revival in interest in ghost stories. Many of
[W BOB HOLLAND][METAPHOR]the high-class magazines have within a few months printed stories withsupernatural incidents, and writers whose names are known to all whoread have turned their attention to this form of literature.Whether or not the reader believe in ghosts, he cannot fail to beinterested in this little book. Without venturing to express a positiveopinion either way, I will only say with Hamlet: [DIALOGUE]"There are more thingsin heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy."W. BOB HOLLAND.
[W BOB HOLLAND][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][EMOTION][CHARACTERIZATION][CONFLICT][DANGER][PLOT][PERSPECTIVE][EXPOSITION][SETTING][METAPHOR][GHOST]Twenty-Five Ghost StoriesTHE BLACK CAT.BY EDGAR ALLAN POE.For the most wild, yet most homely narrative which I am about to pen, Ineither expect nor solicit belief. Mad indeed would I be to expect it,in a case where my very senses reject their own evidence. Yet, mad am I
[W BOB HOLLAND][DEATH]not--and very surely do I not dream. But to-morrow I die, and to-day Iwould unburden my soul. My immediate purpose is to place before theworld, plainly, succinctly and without comment a series of merehousehold events. In their consequences, these events haveterrified--have tortured--have destroyed me. Yet I will not attempt to
[W BOB HOLLAND][HORROR]expound them. To me they have presented little but horror, to many theywill seem less terrible than baroques. Hereafter, perhaps, someintellect may be found which will reduce my phantasm to thecommonplace--some intellect more calm, more logical, and far lessexcitable than my own, which will perceive in the circumstances I detailwith awe nothing more than an ordinary succession of very natural causesand effects.From my infancy I was noted for the docility and humanity of mydisposition. My tenderness of heart was even so conspicuous as to make
[W BOB HOLLAND][CHARACTER][RELIEF][CHARACTERIZATION]me the jest of my companions. I was especially fond of animals, and wasindulged by my parents with a great variety of pets. With these I spentmost of my time, and never was so happy as when feeding and caressingthem. This peculiarity of character grew with my growth, and in mymanhood I derived from it one of my principal sources of pleasure. To
[W BOB HOLLAND][RELIEF][GHOST]those who have cherished an affection for a faithful and sagacious dog,I need hardly be at the trouble of explaining the nature or theintensity of the gratification thus derivable. There is something in theunselfish and self-sacrificing love of a brute, which goes directly tothe heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltryfriendship and gossamer fidelity of mere Man.I married early, and was happy to find in my wife a disposition notuncongenial with my own. Observing my partiality for domestic pets shelost no opportunity of procuring those of the most agreeable kind. We
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][MONSTER]had birds, goldfish, a fine dog, rabbits, a small monkey and a cat.This latter was a remarkably large and beautiful animal, entirely black,and sagacious to an astonishing degree. In speaking of his intelligence,my wife, who at heart was not a little tinctured with superstition, madefrequent allusion to the ancient popular notion, which regarded allblack cats as witches in disguise. Not that she was ever serious uponthis point--and I mention the matter at all for no better reason thanthat it happens, just now, to be remembered.
[W BOB HOLLAND][TRANSITION][EMOTION][CHARACTER][SURPRISE][PLOT][PERSPECTIVE][CONFLICT][CHARACTERIZATION]Pluto--this was the cat’s name--was my favorite pet and playmate. Ialone fed him, and he attended me wherever I went about the house. Itwas even with difficulty that I could prevent him from following methrough the streets.Our friendship lasted, in this manner, for several years, during whichmy general temperament and character--through the instrumentality of thefiend Intemperance--had (I blush to confess it) experienced a radicalalteration for the worse. I grew, day by day, more moody, more
[W BOB HOLLAND][PROBLEM][CONFLICT]irritable, more regardless of the feelings of others. I suffered myselfto use intemperate language to my wife. At length I even offered herpersonal violence. My pets, of course, were made to feel the change inmy disposition. I not only neglected them, but ill-used them. For Pluto,
[W BOB HOLLAND][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][DANGER][ACTION]however, I still retained sufficient regard to restrain me frommaltreating him, as I made no scruple of maltreating the rabbits, themonkey or even the dog, when by accident or through affection they camein my way. But my disease grew upon me--for what disease is likealcohol! And at length even Pluto, who was now becoming old, andconsequently somewhat peevish--even Pluto began to experience theeffects of my ill-temper.One night, returning home much intoxicated from one of my haunts abouttown, I fancied that the cat avoided my presence. I seized him, when, in
[W BOB HOLLAND][DANGER][SURPRISE][WEAPON][CONFLICT][MONSTER]his fright at my violence, he inflicted a slight wound upon my hand withhis teeth. The fury of a demon instantly possessed me. I knew myself nolonger. My original soul seemed, at once, to take its flight from mybody; and a more than fiendish malevolence, gin-nurtured, thrilled everyfiber of my frame. I took from my waistcoat pocket a penknife, opened
[W BOB HOLLAND][EMOTION][MURDER]it, grasped the poor beast by the throat, and deliberately cut one ofits eyes from the socket! I blush, I burn, I shudder while I pen thedamnable atrocity.When reason returned with the morning--when I had slept off the fumes ofthe night’s debauch--I experienced a sentiment half of horror, half ofremorse, for the crime of which I had been guilty; but it was, at best,a feeble and equivocal feeling, and the soul remained untouched. I againplunged into excess, and soon drowned in wine all memory of the deed.
[W BOB HOLLAND][CHARACTERIZATION][METAPHOR][TRANSITION][EXPOSITION][PERSPECTIVE][CHARACTER][HORROR]In the meantime the cat slowly recovered.[Illustration: [DIALOGUE]"_One night, returning home much intoxicated._"]The socket of the lost eye presented, it is true, a frightfulappearance, but he no longer appeared to suffer any pain. He went aboutthe house as usual, but, as might be expected, fled in extreme terror atmy approach. I had so much of my old heart left as to be at first
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][EMOTION][FLASHBACK][GHOST]grieved by this evident dislike on the part of a creature which had onceso loved me. But this feeling soon gave place to irritation. And thencame, as if to my final and irrevocable overthrow, the spirit ofperverseness. Of this spirit philosophy takes no account. Yet I am not
[W BOB HOLLAND][EMOTION][CHARACTER][PROBLEM]more sure that my soul lives than I am that perverseness is one of theprimitive impulses of the human heart--one of the indivisible primaryfaculties or sentiments which give direction to the character of man.Who has not, hundreds of times, found himself committing a vile or sillyaction, for no other reason than because he knows he should not? Have wenot a perpetual inclination, in the teeth of our best judgment, toviolate that which is Law, merely because we understand it to be such?This spirit of perverseness, I say, came to my final overthrow. It was
[W BOB HOLLAND][DANGER][CONFLICT][EMOTION][PROBLEM][DEATH][MURDER]this unfathomable longing of the soul to vex itself--to offer violenceto its own nature--to do wrong for the wrong’s sake only--that urged meto continue and finally to consummate the injury I had inflicted uponthe unoffending brute. One morning, in cold blood, I slipped a nooseabout its neck, and hung it to the limb of a tree; hung it with thetears streaming from my eyes and the bitterest remorse at my heart; hungit because I knew that it had loved me, and because I felt it had givenme no offense; hung it because I knew that in so doing I was committinga sin--a deadly sin that would so jeopardize my immortal soul as toplace it, if such a thing were possible--even beyond the reach of theinfinite mercy of the most merciful and most terrible God.On the night of the day on which this cruel deed was done, I was arousedfrom sleep by the cry of [DIALOGUE]"fire!" The curtains of my bed were in flames.The whole house was blazing. It was with great difficulty that my wife,
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][HORROR]a servant and myself made our escape from the conflagration. Thedestruction was complete. My entire worldly wealth was swallowed up, andI resigned myself thenceforward to despair.I am above the weakness of seeking to establish a sequence of cause andeffect between the disaster and the atrocity. But I am detailing a chain
[W BOB HOLLAND][TRANSITION][SURPRISE]of facts, and wish not to leave even a possible link imperfect. On theday succeeding the fire I visited the ruins. The walls, with oneexception, had fallen in. This exception was found in a compartmentwall, not very thick, which stood about the middle of the house, andagainst which had rested the head of my bed. The plastering had here, in
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][CHARACTERIZATION][CONTEXT][EMOTION][METAPHOR][CONFLICT][MONSTER]great measure, resisted the action of the fire--a fact which Iattributed to its having been recently spread. About this wall a densecrowd were collected, and many persons seemed to be examining aparticular portion of it with very minute and eager attention. The words[DIALOGUE]"strange!" [DIALOGUE]"singular!" and other similar expressions excited mycuriosity. I approached and saw, as if graven in bas-relief upon thewhite surface, the figure of a gigantic cat. The impression was given
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK][PERSPECTIVE][CONTEXT][EMOTION][HORROR]with an accuracy truly marvelous. There was a rope about the animal’sneck.When I first beheld this apparition--for I could scarcely regard it asless--my wonder and my terror were extreme. But at length reflectioncame to my aid. The cat, I remembered, had been hung in a garden
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][CHARACTERIZATION][MURDER]adjacent to the house. Upon the alarm of fire this garden had beenimmediately filled by the crowd--by some one of whom the animal musthave been cut from the tree and thrown through an open window into mychamber. This had probably been done with the view of arousing me fromsleep. The falling of other walls had compressed the victim of mycruelty into the substance of the freshly spread plaster, the lime ofwhich with the flames, and the ammonia from the carcass, had thenaccomplished the portraiture as I saw it.
[W BOB HOLLAND][EMOTION][PERSPECTIVE][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE]Although I thus readily accounted to my reason, if not altogether to myconscience, for the[Illustration: [DIALOGUE]"_Because I knew that it had loved me._"]startling fact just detailed, it did not the less fail to make a deepimpression upon my fancy. For months I could not rid myself of thephantasm of the cat; and, during this period, there came back into myspirit a half sentiment that seemed, but was not, remorse. I went so faras to regret the loss of the animal, and to look about me, among thevile haunts which I now habitually frequented, for another pet of thesame species and of somewhat similar appearance, with which to supplyits place.
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE]One night as I sat, half stupefied, in a den of more than infamy, myattention was suddenly drawn to some black object, reposing upon thehead of one of the immense hogsheads of gin, or of rum, whichconstituted the chief furniture of the apartment. I had been lookingsteadily at the top of this hogshead for some minutes, and what nowcaused me surprise was the fact that I had not sooner perceived theobject thereupon. I approached it and touched it with my hand. It was ablack cat--a very large one--fully as large as Pluto, and closelyresembling him in every respect, but only Pluto had not a white hairupon any portion of his body; but this cat had a large, althoughindefinite, splotch of white, covering nearly the whole region of thebreast.
[W BOB HOLLAND][EMOTION][SURPRISE][ACTION][CHARACTER][ALIEN]Upon my touching him he immediately arose, purred loudly, rubbed againstmy hand, and appeared delighted with my notice. This, then, was thevery creature of which I was in search. I at once offered to purchase itof the landlord; but this person made no claim to it--knew nothing ofit--had never seen it before.I continued my caresses, and when I prepared to go home the animalevinced a disposition to accompany me. I permitted it to do so,
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][EMOTION][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][PERSPECTIVE]occasionally stooping and patting it as I proceeded. When it reached thehouse it domesticated itself at once, and became immediately a greatfavorite with my wife.For my own part, I soon found a dislike to it arising within me. Thiswas just the reverse of what I had anticipated; but--I know not how orwhy it was--its evident fondness for myself rather disgusted and annoyedme. By slow degrees these feelings of disgust and annoyance rose into
[W BOB HOLLAND][EMOTION][CONFLICT][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][MONSTER]the bitterness of hatred. I avoided the creature; a certain sense ofshame, and the remembrance of my former deed of cruelty, preventing mefrom physically abusing it. I did not, for some weeks, strike, orotherwise violently ill use it; but gradually--very gradually--I came tolook upon it with unutterable loathing, and to flee silently from itsodious presence, as from the breath of a pestilence.What added, no doubt, to my hatred of the beast, was the discovery, onthe morning after I brought it home, that, like Pluto, it also had beendeprived of one of its eyes. This circumstance, however, only endeared
[W BOB HOLLAND]it to my wife, who, as I have already said, possessed, in a high degree,that humanity of feeling which had once been my distinguishing trait,and the source of many of my simplest and purest pleasures.With my aversion to this cat, however, its partiality for myself seemedto increase. It followed my footsteps with a pertinacity which it wouldbe difficult to make the reader comprehend. Whenever I sat it wouldcrouch beneath my chair or spring upon my knees, covering me with itsloathsome caresses. If I arose to walk it would get between my feet, and
[W BOB HOLLAND][METAPHOR][FLASHBACK][CONFLICT][PLOT][EMOTION][CHARACTERIZATION][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][CONTEXT][HORROR]thus nearly throw me down, or, fastening its long and sharp claws in mydress, clamber, in this manner, to my breast. At such times, although Ilonged to destroy it with a blow, I was yet withheld from so doing,partly by a memory of my former crime, but chiefly--let me confess it atonce--by absolute dread of the beast.This dread was not exactly a dread of physical evil--and yet I should beat a loss how otherwise to define it. I am almost ashamed to own--yes,even in this felon’s cell, I am almost ashamed to own--that the terrorand horror with which the animal inspired me had been heightened by oneof the merest chimeras it would be possible to conceive. My wife had
[W BOB HOLLAND][DANGER][CHARACTER][CHARACTERIZATION][PROBLEM][METAPHOR][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][FLASHBACK][MONSTER]called my attention more than once, to the character of the mark ofwhite hair, of which I have spoken, and which[Illustration: [DIALOGUE]"_The figure of a gigantic cat._"]constituted the sole visible difference between the strange beast andthe one I had destroyed. The reader will remember that this mark,although large, had been originally very indefinite; but, by slowdegrees--degrees nearly imperceptible, and which for a long time myreason struggled to reject as fanciful--it had, at length, assumed arigorous distinctness of outline. It was now the representation of anobject that I shudder to name--and for this, above all, I loathed anddreaded, and would have rid myself of the monster had I dared--it wasnow I say the image of a hideous, of a ghastly thing--of the gallows!
[W BOB HOLLAND][PROBLEM][DEATH][CONFLICT][DANGER][HORROR]Oh, mournful and terrible engine of horror and of crime--of agony and ofdeath!And now was I indeed wretched beyond the wretchedness of mere humanity.And a brute beast, whose fellow I had contemptuously destroyed--a brutebeast to work out for me--for me, a man, fashioned in the image of theHigh God--so much of insufferable woe. Alas! neither by day nor night
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][DANGER][PROBLEM][TRANSITION][EMOTION][HORROR]knew I the blessing of rest any more. During the former the creatureleft me no moment alone, and in the latter I started hourly from dreamsof unutterable fear, to find the hot breath of the thing upon my face,and its vast weight--an incarnate nightmare that I had no power to shakeoff--incumbent eternally upon my heart.Beneath the pressure of torments such as these the feeble remnants ofthe good within me succumbed. Evil thoughts became my soleintimates--the darkest and most evil of thoughts. The moodiness of my
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT]usual temper increased to hatred of all things and of all mankind;while, from the sudden, frequent and ungovernable outbursts of a fury towhich I now blindly abandoned myself, my uncomplaining wife, alas! wasthe most usual and the most patient of sufferers.One day she accompanied me upon some household errand into the cellar ofthe old building, which our poverty compelled us to inhabit. The catfollowed me down the steep stairs, and, nearly throwing me headlong,exasperated me to madness. Uplifting an axe, and forgetting, in my
[W BOB HOLLAND][EMOTION]wrath, the childish dread which had hitherto stayed my hand, I aimed ablow at the animal which, of course, would have proved instantly fatalhad it descended as I wished. But this blow was arrested by the hand ofmy wife. Goaded, by the interference, into a rage more than demoniacal,I withdrew my arm from her grasp, and buried the ax in her brain. Shefell dead upon the spot, without a groan.
[W BOB HOLLAND][DANGER][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][ACTION][DEATH][TRANSITION][MURDER]This hideous murder accomplished, I set myself forthwith, and withentire deliberation, to the task of concealing the body. I knew that Icould not remove it from the house, either by day or by night, withoutthe risk of being observed by the neighbors. Many projects entered mymind. At one period I thought of cutting the corpse into minutefragments and destroying them by fire. At another I resolved to dig a
[W BOB HOLLAND]grave for it in the floor of the cellar. Again, I deliberated aboutcasting it into the well in the yard--about packing it in a box, as ifmerchandise, with the usual arrangements, and so getting a porter totake it from the house. Finally I hit upon what I considered a farbetter expedient than either of these. I determined to wall it up in thecellar--as the monks of the middle ages are recorded to have walled uptheir victims.For a purpose such as this the cellar was well adapted. Its walls were
[W BOB HOLLAND]loosely constructed, and had lately been plastered throughout with arough plaster, which the dampness of the atmosphere had prevented fromhardening. Moreover, in one of the walls was a projection, caused by afalse chimney, or fireplace, that had been filled up, and made toresemble the rest of the cellar. I made no doubt that I could readilydisplace the bricks at this point, insert the corpse, and wall the wholeup as before, so that no eye could detect anything suspicious.And in this calculation I was not deceived. By means of a crowbar I
[W BOB HOLLAND][ACTION]easily dislodged the bricks, and, having carefully deposited the bodyagainst the inner wall, I propped it in that position, while, withlittle trouble, I relaid the whole structure as it originally stood.Having[Illustration: [DIALOGUE]"_An extraordinary cat._"]procured mortar, sand and hair with every possible precaution, Iprepared a plaster which could not be distinguished from the old, andwith this I very carefully went over the new brickwork. When I hadfinished I felt satisfied that all was right. The wall did not present
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][HORROR]the slightest appearance of having been disturbed. The rubbish on thefloor was picked up with the minutest care. I looked around triumphantlyand said to myself, [DIALOGUE]"Here, at least, then, my labor has not been invain."My next step was to look for the beast which had been the cause of somuch wretchedness, for I had at length firmly resolved to put it todeath. Had I been able to meet with it at the moment there could havebeen no doubt of its fate; but it appeared that the crafty animal hadbeen alarmed at the violence of my previous anger and forebore topresent itself in my present mood. It is impossible to describe or to
[W BOB HOLLAND][RELIEF][EMOTION][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][CLIMAX][PERSPECTIVE][MONSTER]imagine the deep, the blissful sense of relief which the absence of thedetested creature occasioned in my bosom. It did not make its appearanceduring the night--and thus, for one night at least since itsintroduction into the house, I soundly and tranquilly slept--aye, slept,even with the burden of murder upon my soul!The second and the third day passed, and still my tormentor came not.Once again I breathed as a free man. The monster, in terror, had fled
[W BOB HOLLAND][RELIEF][SURPRISE][EMOTION][CONFLICT][HORROR]the premises forever! I should behold it no more! My happiness wassupreme! The guilt of my dark deed disturbed me but little. Some few
[W BOB HOLLAND][MURDER]inquiries had been made, but these had been readily answered. Even asearch had been instituted--but, of course, nothing was to bediscovered. I looked upon my future felicity as secured.Upon the fourth day of the assassination a party of the police came veryunexpectedly into the house and proceeded again to make a rigorousinvestigation of the premises. Secure, however, in the inscrutability of
[W BOB HOLLAND]my place of concealment, I felt no embarrassment whatever. The officersbade me accompany them in their search. They left no nook or cornerunexplored. At length, for the third or fourth time, they descended intothe cellar. I quivered not in a muscle. My heart beat as calmly as that
[W BOB HOLLAND][EMOTION][RELIEF][TRANSITION][CHARACTER][PERSPECTIVE][VAMPIRE]of one who slumbers in innocence. I walked the cellar from end to end. Ifolded my arms upon my bosom and roamed easily to and fro. The policewere thoroughly satisfied and prepared to depart. The glee at my heart
[W BOB HOLLAND]was too strong to be restrained. I burned to say but one word, by way oftriumph, and to render doubly sure their assurance of my guiltlessness.[DIALOGUE]"Gentlemen," I said at last, as the party ascended the steps, [DIALOGUE]"I delightto have allayed your suspicions. I wish you all health and a littlemore courtesy. By the by, gentlemen, this--this is a very wellconstructed house." (In the rabid desire to say something easily Iscarcely knew what I uttered at all.) "I may say an excellently wellconstructed house. These walls--are you going, gentlemen?--these walls
[W BOB HOLLAND][DANGER][EMOTION][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][HORROR]are solidly put together;" and here, through the mere frenzy of bravado,I rapped heavily, with a cane which I held in my hand, upon that veryportion of the brickwork behind which stood the corpse of the wife of mybosom.But may God shield and deliver me from the fangs of the Arch Fiend! Nosooner had the reverberation of my blows sunk into silence than I wasanswered by a voice from within the tomb!--by a cry, at first muffledand broken, like the sobbing of a child, and then quickly swelling intoone long, loud and continuous scream, utterly anomalous and inhuman--ahowl!--a wailing shriek, half of horror and half of triumph, such as
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][HELL]might have arisen only out of hell, conjointly from the throats of thedamned in their agony and of the demons that exult in the damnation.Of my own thoughts it is folly to speak. Swooning, I staggered to theopposite wall. For an instant the party upon the stairs remainedmotionless, through extremity of terror and of awe. In the next a dozen
[W BOB HOLLAND][DANGER][DEATH][CONFLICT][MONSTER]stout arms were toiling at the wall. It fell bodily. The corpse, alreadygetting decayed and clotted with gore, stood erect before the eyes ofthe spectators. Upon its head, with red, extended mouth and solitary eyeof fire, sat the hideous beast whose craft had seduced me into murder,and whose informing voice had consigned me to the hangman. I had walled
[W BOB HOLLAND][FLASHBACK][METAPHOR][CONFLICT][DANGER]the monster up within the tomb!THE FLAYED HAND.BY GUY DE MAUPASSANT.One evening about eight months ago I met with some college comrades atthe lodgings of our friend Louis R. We drank punch and smoked, talked of
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT]literature and art, and made jokes like any other company of young men.Suddenly the door flew open, and one who had been my friend sinceboyhood burst in like a hurricane.[DIALOGUE]"Guess where I come from?" he cried.[DIALOGUE]"I bet on the Mabille," responded one. [DIALOGUE]"No," said another, [DIALOGUE]"you are toogay; you come from borrowing money, from burying a rich uncle, or frompawning your watch." [DIALOGUE]"You are getting sober," cried a third, [DIALOGUE]"and, asyou scented the punch in Louis’ room, you came up here to get drunkagain."[DIALOGUE]"You are all wrong," he replied. "I come from P., in Normandy, where I
[W BOB HOLLAND][DANGER][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][CHARACTER][MURDER]have spent eight days, and whence I have brought one of my friends, agreat criminal, whom I ask permission to present to you."With these words he drew from his pocket a long, black hand, from whichthe skin had been stripped. It had been severed at the wrist. Its dryand shriveled shape, and the narrow, yellowed nails still clinging tothe fingers, made it frightful to look upon. The muscles, which showed
[W BOB HOLLAND]that its first owner had been possessed of great strength, were bound inplace by a strip of parchment-like skin.[DIALOGUE]"Just fancy," said my friend, [DIALOGUE]"the other day they sold the effects of anold sorcerer, recently deceased, well known in all the country. EverySaturday night he used to go to witch gatherings on a broomstick; hepractised the white magic and the black, gave blue milk to the cows, andmade them wear tails like that of the companion of Saint Anthony. Theold scoundrel always had a deep affection for this hand, which, he said,was that of a celebrated criminal, executed in 1736 for having thrownhis lawful wife head first into a well--for which I do not blamehim--and then hanging in the belfry the priest who had married him.After this double exploit he went away, and, during his subsequentcareer, which was brief but exciting, he robbed twelve travelers, smokeda score of monks in their monastery, and made a seraglio of a convent."[DIALOGUE]"But what are you going to do with this horror?" we cried.[DIALOGUE]"Eh! parbleu! I will make it the handle to my door-bell and frighten mycreditors."[DIALOGUE]"My friend," said Henry Smith, a big, phlegmatic Englishman, [DIALOGUE]"I believethat this hand is only a kind of Indian meat, preserved by a newprocess; I advise you to make bouillon of it."[DIALOGUE]"Rail not, messieurs," said, with the utmost sang froid, a medicalstudent who was three-quarters drunk, [DIALOGUE]"but if you follow my advice,Pierre, you will give this piece of human debris Christian burial, forfear lest its owner should come to demand it. Then, too, this hand hasacquired some bad habits, for you know the proverb, ‘Who has killed willkill.’"[DIALOGUE]"And who has drank will drink," replied the host as he poured out a bigglass of punch for the student, who emptied it at a draught and sliddead drunk under the table. His sudden dropping out of the company wasgreeted with a burst of laughter, and Pierre, raising his glass andsaluting the hand, cried:[DIALOGUE]"I drink to the next visit of thy master."Then the conversation turned upon other subjects, and shortly afterwardeach returned to his lodgings.
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK]       *       *       *       *       *About two o’clock the next day, as I was passing Pierre’s door, Ientered and found him reading and smoking.[DIALOGUE]"Well, how goes it?" said I. [DIALOGUE]"Very well," he responded. [DIALOGUE]"And your hand?""My hand? Did you not see it on the bell-pull? I put it there when I
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT]returned home last night. But, apropos of this, what do you think? Someidiot, doubtless to play a stupid joke on me, came ringing at my doortowards midnight. I demanded who was there, but as no one replied, Iwent back to bed again, and to sleep."
[W BOB HOLLAND][PROBLEM][MURDER]At this moment the door opened and the landlord, a fat and extremelyimpertinent person, entered without saluting us.[DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE]"Sir," said he, [DIALOGUE]"I pray you to take away immediately that carrion whichyou have hung to your bell-pull. Unless you do this I shall be compelledto ask you to leave.""Sir," responded Pierre, with much gravity, [DIALOGUE]"you insult a hand whichdoes not merit it. Know you that it belonged to a man of high breeding?"The landlord turned on his heel and made his exit, without speaking.Pierre followed him, detached the hand and affixed it to the bell-cordhanging in his alcove.[DIALOGUE]"That is better," he said. [DIALOGUE]"This hand, like the ‘Brother, all must die,’of the Trappists, will give my thoughts a serious turn every nightbefore I sleep."At the end of an hour I left him and returned to my own apartment.I slept badly the following night, was nervous and agitated, and severaltimes awoke with a start. Once I imagined, even, that a man had broken
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][EMOTION][DANGER][MURDER]into my room, and I sprang up and searched the closets and under thebed. Towards six o’clock in the morning I was commencing to doze atlast, when a loud knocking at my door made me jump from my couch. It wasmy friend Pierre’s servant, half dressed, pale and trembling.[DIALOGUE]"Ah, sir!" cried he, sobbing, [DIALOGUE]"my poor master. Someone has murderedhim."I dressed myself hastily and ran to Pierre’s lodgings. The house wasfull of people disputing together, and everything was in a commotion.
[W BOB HOLLAND]Everyone was talking at the same time, recounting and commenting on theoccurrence in all sorts of ways. With great difficulty I reached thebedroom, made myself known to those guarding the door and was permittedto enter. Four agents of police were standing in the middle of theapartment, pencils in hand, examining every detail, conferring in lowvoices and writing from time to time in their note-books. Two doctorswere in consultation by the bed on which lay the unconscious form ofPierre. He was not dead, but his face was fixed in an expression of the
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][HORROR]most awful terror. His eyes were open their widest, and the dilatedpupils seemed to regard fixedly, with unspeakable horror, somethingunknown and frightful. His hands were clinched. I raised the quilt,which covered his body from the chin downward, and saw on his neck,deeply sunk in the flesh, the marks of fingers. Some drops of blood
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][DANGER][TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][HORROR]spotted his shirt. At that moment one thing struck me. I chanced tonotice that the shriveled hand was no longer attached to the bell-cord.The doctors had doubtless removed it to avoid the comments of thoseentering the chamber where the wounded man lay, because the appearanceof this hand was indeed frightful. I did not inquire what had become of
[W BOB HOLLAND][DANGER][ACTION][CONTEXT][PROBLEM][MURDER]it.I now clip from a newspaper of the next day the story of the crime withall the details that the police were able to procure:"A frightful attempt was made yesterday on the life of young M. PierreB., student, who belongs to one of the best families in Normandy. He
[W BOB HOLLAND][EMOTION][DANGER]returned home about ten o’clock in the evening, and excused his valet,Bouvin, from further attendance upon him, saying that he felt fatiguedand was going to bed. Towards midnight Bouvin was suddenly awakened bythe furious ringing of his master’s bell. He was afraid, and lighted alamp and waited. The bell was silent about a minute, then rang againwith such vehemence that the domestic, mad with fright, flew from hisroom to awaken the concierge, who ran to summon the police, and, at theend of about fifteen minutes, two policemen forced open the door. A
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][DANGER][EMOTION][SURPRISE][CHARACTER][PROBLEM][CONTEXT][HORROR]horrible sight met their eyes. The furniture was overturned, givingevidence of a fearful struggle between the victim and his assailant. Inthe middle of the room, upon his back, his body rigid, with livid faceand frightfully dilated eyes, lay, motionless, young Pierre B., bearingupon his neck the deep imprints of five fingers. Dr. Bourdean was called
[W BOB HOLLAND][HORROR]immediately, and his report says that the aggressor must have beenpossessed of prodigious strength and have had an extraordinarily thinand sinewy hand, because the fingers left in the flesh of the victimfive holes like those from a pistol ball, and had penetrated until theyalmost met. There is no clue to the motive of the crime or to itsperpetrator. The police are making a thorough investigation.[DIALOGUE]"The following appeared in the same newspaper next day:"M. Pierre B., the victim of the frightful assault of which we published
[W BOB HOLLAND][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][CONFLICT]an account yesterday, has regained consciousness after two hours of themost assiduous care by Dr. Bourdean. His life is not in danger, but itis strongly feared that he has lost his reason. No trace has been foundof his assailant."My poor friend was indeed insane. For seven months I visited him daily
[W BOB HOLLAND][DEATH][CONFLICT][EMOTION][DANGER][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK][HORROR]at the hospital where we had placed him, but he did not recover thelight of reason. In his delirium strange words escaped him, and, likeall madmen, he had one fixed idea: he believed himself continuallypursued by a specter. One day they came for me in haste, saying he wasworse, and when I arrived I found him dying. For two hours he remainedvery calm, then, suddenly, rising from his bed in spite of our efforts,he cried, waving his arms as if a prey to the most awful terror: [DIALOGUE]"Takeit away! Take it away! It strangles me! Help! Help!" Twice he made thecircuit of the room, uttering horrible screams, then fell face downward,dead.
[W BOB HOLLAND][EMOTION][SURPRISE]       *       *       *       *       *As he was an orphan I was charged to take his body to the little villageof P., in Normandy, where his parents were buried. It was the place fromwhich he had arrived the evening he found us drinking punch in LouisR.’s room, when he had presented to us the flayed hand. His body wasinclosed in a leaden coffin, and four days afterwards I walked sadlybeside the old cure, who had given him his first lessons, to the littlecemetery where they dug his grave. It was a beautiful day, and sunshine
[W BOB HOLLAND][FLASHBACK]from a cloudless sky flooded the earth. Birds sang from the blackberrybushes where many a time when we were children we had stolen to eat thefruit. Again I saw Pierre and myself creeping along behind the hedge andslipping through the gap that we knew so well, down at the end of thelittle plot where they bury the poor. Again we would return to the housewith cheeks and lips black with the juice of the berries we had eaten. I
[W BOB HOLLAND]looked at the bushes; they were covered with fruit; mechanically Ipicked some and bore it to my mouth. The cure had opened his breviary,and was muttering his prayers in a low voice. I heard at the end of thewalk the spades of the grave-diggers who were opening the tomb. Suddenlythey called out, the cure closed his book, and we went to see what theywished of us. They had found a coffin; in digging a stroke of the
[W BOB HOLLAND]pickaxe had started the cover, and we perceived within a skeleton ofunusual stature, lying on its back, its hollow eyes seeming yet tomenace and defy us. I was troubled, I know not why, and almost afraid.[DIALOGUE]"Hold!" cried one of the men, [DIALOGUE]"look there! One of the rascal’s hands hasbeen severed at the wrist. Ah, here it is!" and he picked up from besidethe body a huge withered hand, and held it out to us.[DIALOGUE]"See," cried the other, laughing, [DIALOGUE]"see how he glares at you, as if hewould spring at your throat to make you give him back his hand."[DIALOGUE]"Go," said the cure, [DIALOGUE]"leave the dead in peace, and close the coffin. Wewill make poor Pierre’s grave elsewhere."The next day all was finished, and I returned to Paris, after havingleft fifty francs with the old cure for masses to be said for the reposeof the soul of him whose sepulchre we had troubled.THE VENGEANCE OF A TREE.BY ELEANOR F. LEWIS.
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][DANGER][PROBLEM][EMOTION][DEATH][ACTION][TRANSITION][SETTING][MURDER]Through the windows of Jim Daly’s saloon, in the little town of C----,the setting sun streamed in yellow patches, lighting up the glassesscattered on the tables and the faces of several men who were gatherednear the bar. Farmers mostly they were, with a sprinkling ofshopkeepers, while prominent among them was the village editor, and allwere discussing a startling piece of news that had spread through thetown and its surroundings. The tidings that Walter Stedman, a laborer onAlbert Kelsey’s ranch, had assaulted and murdered his employer’sdaughter, had reached them, and had spread universal horror among thepeople.A farmer declared that he had seen the deed committed as he walkedthrough a neighboring lane, and, having always been noted for hiscowardice, instead of running to the girl’s aid, had hailed a party ofminers who were returning from their mid-day meal through a field nearby. When they reached the spot, however, where Stedman (as they
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][DEATH][CONFLICT][DANGER][MURDER]supposed) had done his black deed, only the girl lay there, in thestillness of death. Her murderer had taken the opportunity to fly. Theparty had searched the woods of the Kelsey estate, and just as they werenearing the house itself the appearance of Walter Stedman, walking in astrangely unsteady manner toward it, made them quicken their pace.He was soon in custody, although he had protested his innocence of thecrime. He said that he had just seen the body himself on his way to the
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT]station, and that when they had found him he was going to the house forhelp. But they had laughed at his story and had flung him into the tiny,stifling calaboose of the town.What were their proofs? Walter Stedman, a young fellow of abouttwenty-six, had come from the city to their quiet town, just when timeswere at their hardest, in search of work. The most of the men living in
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][WEAPON][ACTION]the town were honest fellows, doing their work faithfully, when theycould get it, and when they had socially asked Stedman to have a drinkwith them, he had refused in rather a scornful manner. [DIALOGUE]"That infernalcity chap," he was called, and their hate and envy increased in strengthwhen Albert Kelsey had employed him in preference to any of themselves.As time went on, the story of Stedman’s admiration for Margaret Kelseyhad gone afloat, with the added information that his employer’sdaughter had repulsed him, saying that she would not marry a commonlaborer. So Stedman, when this news reached his employer’s ears, wasdischarged, and this, then, was his revenge! For them, these proofs were
[W BOB HOLLAND][DANGER]sufficient to pronounce him guilty.Yet that afternoon, as Stedman, crouched on the floor of the calaboose,grew hopeless in the knowledge that no one would believe his story, andthat his undeserved punishment would be swift and sure, a tramp,boarding a freight car several miles from the town, sped away from thespot where his crime had been committed, and knew that forever itsshadow would follow him.From the tiny window of his prison Walter Stedman could see the red glowof the heavens that betokened the setting of the sun. So the red sun ofhis life was soon to set, a life that had been innocent of all crime,and that now was to be ended for a deed that he had never committed.
[W BOB HOLLAND][FLASHBACK][CONFLICT][DANGER][MURDER]Most prominent of all the visions that swept through his mind was thatof Margaret Kelsey, lying as he had first found her, fresh from thehands of her murderer. But there was another of a more tender nature.How long he and Margaret had tried to keep their secret, until Waltercould be promoted to a higher position, so that he could ask for herhand with no fear of the father’s antagonism! Then came the remembranceof an afternoon meeting between the two in the woods of the Kelseyestate--how, just as they were parting, Walter had heard footsteps nearthem, and, glancing sharply around, saw an evil, scowling, murderousface peering through the brush. He had started toward it, but the owner
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][DANGER][PROBLEM]of the countenance had taken himself hurriedly off.The gossiping townspeople had misconstrued this romance, and when AlbertKelsey had heard of this clandestine meeting from the man who was lateron to appear as a leader of the mob, and that he had discharged Stedman,they had believed that the young man had formally proposed and had beenrejected. But justice had gone wrong, as it had done innumerable timesbefore, and will again. An innocent man was to be hanged, even withoutthe comfort of a trial, while the man who was guilty was free to wanderwhere he would.
[W BOB HOLLAND]That autumn night the darkness came quickly, and only the stars didtheir best to light the scene. A body of men, all masked, and having asa leader one who had ever since Stedman’s arrival in town, cherished asecret hatred of the young man, dragged Stedman from the calaboose andtramped through the town, defying all, defying even God himself. Alongthe highway, and into Farmer Brown’s [DIALOGUE]"cross cut," they went, vigilantlyguarding their prisoner, who, with the lanterns lighting up his haggardface, walked among them with the lagging step of utter hopelessness.[DIALOGUE]"That’s a good tree," their leader said, presently, stopping andpointing out a spreading oak; when the slipknot was adjusted and Stedmanhad stepped on the box, he added: [DIALOGUE]"If you’ve got anything to say, you’dbetter say it now."[DIALOGUE]"I am innocent, I swear before God," the doomed man answered; [DIALOGUE]"I nevertook the life of Margaret Kelsey."[DIALOGUE]"Give us your proof," jeered the leader, and when Stedman kept adespairing silence, he laughed shortly.[DIALOGUE]"Ready, men!" he gave the order. The box was kicked aside, andthen--only a writhing body swung to and fro in the gloom.
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][CONFLICT]In front of the men stood their leader, watching the contortions of thebody with silent glee. [DIALOGUE]"I’ll tell you a secret, boys," he said suddenly.[DIALOGUE]"I was after that poor murdered girl myself. A d---- little chance Ihad; but, by ----, he had just as little!"A pause--then: [DIALOGUE]"He’s shunted this earth. Cut him down, you fellows!"       *       *       *       *       *"It’s no use, son. I’ll give up the blasted thing as a bad job. There’ssomething queer about that there tree. Do you see how its branches
[W BOB HOLLAND][DANGER][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][HELL]balance it? We have cut the trunk nearly in two, but it won’t come down.There’s plenty of others around; we’ll take one of them. If I’d a longrope with me I’d get that tree down, and yet the way the thing stands itwould be risking a fellow’s life to climb it. It’s got the devil in it,
[W BOB HOLLAND][PERSPECTIVE]sure."So old Farmer Brown shouldered his axe and made for another tree, hisson following. They had sawed and chopped and chopped and sawed, and yetthe tall white oak, with its branches jutting out almost as regularly asif done by the work of a machine, stood straight and firm.Farmer Brown, well known for his weak, cowardly spirit, who in beholdingthe murder of Albert Kelsey’s daughter, had in his fright mistaken thecriminal, now in his superstition let the oak stand, because itswell-balanced position saved it from falling, when other trees wouldhave been down. And so this tree, the same one to which an innocent man
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][DEATH][MURDER]had been hanged, was left--for other work.It was a bleak, rainy night--such a night as can be found only incentral California. The wind howled like a thousand demons, and lashedthe trees together in wild embraces. Now and then the weird [DIALOGUE]"hoot,hoot!" of an owl came softly from the distance in the lulls of thestorm, while the barking of coyotes woke the echoes of the hills intosounds like fiendish laughter.
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][EMOTION][DANGER][TRANSITION][FLASHBACK]In the wind and rain a man fought his path through the bush and intoFarmer Brown’s [DIALOGUE]"cross cut," as the shortest way home. Suddenly hestopped, trembling, as if held by some unseen impulse. Before him rosethe white oak, wavering and swaying in the storm.[DIALOGUE]"Good God! it’s the tree I swung Stedman from!" he cried, and a strangefear thrilled him.His eyes were fixed on it, held by some undefinable fascination. Yes,
[W BOB HOLLAND][EMOTION][CONFLICT][MURDER]there on one of the longest branches a small piece of rope stilldangled. And then, to the murderer’s excited vision, this rope seemed tolengthen, to form at the end into a slipknot, a knot that encircled apurple neck, while below it writhed and swayed the body of a man![DIALOGUE]"Damn him!" he muttered, starting toward the hanging form, as if aboutto help the rope in its work of strangulation; [DIALOGUE]"will he forever followme? And yet he deserved it, the black-hearted villain! He took herlife----"He never finished the sentence. The white oak, towering above him in its
[W BOB HOLLAND][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][ACTION][SURPRISE][DANGER][METAPHOR][GHOST]strength, seemed to grow like a frenzied, living creature. There was asudden splitting sound, then came a crash, and under the fallen tree layStedman’s murderer, crushed and mangled.From between the broken trunk and the stump that was left, a gray, dimshape sprang out, and sped past the man’s still form, away into the wildblackness of the night.THE PARLOR-CAR GHOST.
[W BOB HOLLAND][EMOTION][METAPHOR][TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][SURPRISE][SETTING][CONTEXT][CONFLICT]All draped with blue denim--the seaside cottage of my friend, Sara Pyne.She asked me to go there with her when she opened it to have it set inorder for the summer. She confessed that she felt a trifle nervous atthe idea of entering it alone. And I am always ready for an excursion.
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE]So much blue denim rather surprised me, because blue is notcomplimentary to Sara’s complexion--she always wears some shade of red,by preference. She perceived my wonder; she is very near-sighted, andtherefore sees everything by some sort of sixth sense.[DIALOGUE]"You do not like my portieres and curtains and table-covers," said she."Neither do I. But I did it to accommodate. And now he rests well in his
[W BOB HOLLAND][FLASHBACK]grave, I hope.[DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE]""Whose grave, for pity’s sake?""Mr. J. Billington Price’s.""And who is he? He doesn’t sound interesting.""Then I will tell you about him,[DIALOGUE]" said Sara, taking a seat directly infront of one of those curtains. "Last autumn I was leaving this placefor New York, traveling on the fast express train known as the FlyingYankee. Of course, I thought of the Flying Dutchman and Wagner’s musicalsetting of the uncanny legend, and how different things are in thesedays of steam, etc. Then I looked out of the window at the landscape,
[W BOB HOLLAND][METAPHOR]the horizon that seemed to wheel in a great curve as the train sped on.Every now and then I had an impression at the ‘tail of the eye’ that aman was sitting in a chair three or four numbers in front of me on theopposite side of the car. Each time that I saw this shape I looked atthe chair and ascertained that it was unoccupied. But it was an oddtrick of vision. I raised my lorgnette, and the chair showed emptier
[W BOB HOLLAND][DANGER][EMOTION][SUSPENSE][PERSPECTIVE][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][CHARACTER][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][FLASHBACK][CONTEXT][HORROR]than before. There was nobody in it, certainly. But the more I knew thatit was vacant the more plainly I saw the man. Always with the corner ofmy eye. It made me nervous. When passengers entered the car I dreaded
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][SUSPENSE][PROBLEM][TRANSITION][EMOTION][DANGER][PERSPECTIVE][CONTEXT][ACTION]lest they might take that seat. What would happen if they should? A bagwas put in the chair--that made me uncomfortable. The bag was removed atthe next station. Then a baby was placed in the seat. It began to laugh
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][PERSPECTIVE][METAPHOR]as though someone had gently tickled it. There was something odd aboutthat chair--thirteen was its number. When I looked away from it theimpression was strong upon me that some person sitting there waswatching me."Really, it would not do to humor such fancies. So I touched the
[W BOB HOLLAND][TRANSITION][EMOTION][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][ACTION][SUSPENSE][PERSPECTIVE][FLASHBACK][EXPOSITION]electric button, asked the porter to bring me a table, and taking frommy bag a pack of cards, proceeded to divert myself with a game ofpatience. I was puzzling where to put a seven of spades. ‘Where can itgo?’ I murmured to myself. A voice behind me prompted: ‘Play the four of
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT]diamonds on the five, and you can do it.’ I started. The only occupantsof the car, besides me, were a bridal couple, a mother with three littlechildren, and a typical preacher of one of the straitest sects. Who hadspoken? ‘Play up the four, madam,’ repeated this voice.
[W BOB HOLLAND][DANGER][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][METAPHOR][CHARACTER][GHOST]"I looked fearfully over my shoulder. At first I saw a bluish cloud,like cigar smoke, but inodorous. Then the vision cleared, and I saw ayoung man whom I knew by a subtle intuition to be the occupant, seen andnot seen, of chair number thirteen. Evidently he was a travelingsalesman--and a ghost. Of course, a drummer’s ghost sounds
[W BOB HOLLAND][PROBLEM][DANGER][CHARACTER][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][EMOTION][EXPOSITION][CHARACTERIZATION][GHOST]ridiculous--they’re so extremely alive! Or else you would expect a deaddrummer to be particularly dead and not ‘walk.’ This was a mostcommonplace-looking ghost, cordial, pushing, businesslike. At the sametime, his face had an expression of utter despair and horror which madehim still more preposterous. Of course it is not nice to let a stranger
[W BOB HOLLAND][DANGER][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][EMOTION][GHOST]speak to one, even on so impersonal a topic as a four of diamonds. But aghost--there can’t be any rule of etiquette about talking with a ghost!My dear, it was dreadful! That forward creature showed me how to playall the cards, and then begged me to lay them out again, in order thathe might give me some clever points. I was too much amazed and disturbed
[W BOB HOLLAND][CHARACTERIZATION][METAPHOR][SURPRISE][PLOT][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][FLASHBACK][GHOST]to speak. I could only place the cards at his suggestion. This I did soas not to appear to be listening to the empty air, and be supposed to bea crazy woman. Presently the ghost spoke again, and told me his story.
[W BOB HOLLAND][TRANSITION]"‘Madam,’ he said, ‘I have been riding back and forth on this car eversince February 22, 189--. Seven months and eleven days. All this time Ihave not exchanged a word with anyone. For a drummer, that is prettyhard, you may believe! You know the story of the Flying Dutchman? Well,
[W BOB HOLLAND][PROBLEM][DANGER][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK][CONFLICT][HORROR]that is very nearly my case. A curse is upon me and will not be removeduntil some kind soul----. But I’m getting ahead of my text. That daythere were four of us, traveling for different houses. One of the boys
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT]was in wool, one in baking powder, one in boots and shoes, and myself incotton goods. We met on the road, took seats together and fell intotalking shop."‘Those fellows told big lies about their sales, Washington’s Birthdaythough it was. The baking powder man raised the amount of the bills ofgoods which he had sold better than a whole can of his stuff could havedone. I admitted the straight truth, that I had not yet been able to
[W BOB HOLLAND]make a sale. And then I swore--not in a light-minded, chipper style ofverbal trimmings, but a great, round, heaven-defying oath--that I wouldsell a case of blue denims on that trip if it took me forever. We becamedry with talk, and when the train stopped at Rivermouth, we went out tohave some beer. It is good there, you know--pardon me, I forgot that Iwas speaking to a lady. Well, we had to run to get aboard. I missed my
[W BOB HOLLAND][MURDER]footing, fell under the wheels, and the next thing that I knew they wereholding an inquest over my remains; while I, disemboweled, was sittingon a corner of the undertaker’s table, wondering which of the coroner’sjury was likely to want a case of blue denims."‘Then I remembered my wicked oath, and understood that I was a souldoomed to wander until I could succeed in selling that bill of goods. Ispoke once or twice, offering the denims under value, but nobody noticedme. Verdict: accidental death; negligence of deceased; railroadcorporation not to blame; deceased got out for beer at his own risk. Theother drummers took charge of the remains, and wrote a beautiful letterto my relatives about my social qualities and my impressiveconversation. I wish it had been less impressive that time! I might have
[W BOB HOLLAND][FLASHBACK][METAPHOR][SURPRISE]lied about my sales, or I might have said that I hoped for better luck.But after that oath there was nothing for it. Back and forth, back andforth, on this road, in chair number thirteen, to all eternity. Nobodysuspects my presence. They sit on my knees--I’m playing in luck when it
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][METAPHOR]is a nice baby as it was this afternoon! They pile wraps, bags, evenrailway literature on me. They play cards under my nose--and whatduffers some of them are! You, madam, are the first person who hasperceived me; and therefore I ventured to speak to you, meaning nooffense. I can see that you are sorry for me. Now, if you recall the
[W BOB HOLLAND][METAPHOR][SURPRISE][CHARACTERIZATION][CHARACTER][PERSPECTIVE][EXPOSITION]story of the Flying Dutchman, he was saved by the charity of a goodwoman. In fact, Senta married him. Now I’m not asking anything of thatsize. I see that you wear a wedding ring, and no doubt you make someman’s happiness. I wasn’t a marrying man myself, and, naturally, am not
[W BOB HOLLAND][METAPHOR][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK][CHARACTERIZATION][GHOST]a marrying ghost. And that has nothing to do with the matter anyway. Butif you could--I don’t suppose you would have any use for them--but ifyou were disposed to do a turn of good, solid, Christian charity--Ishould be everlastingly grateful, and you may have that case of denimsat $72.50. And that quality is quoted to-day at $80. Does it go, madam?’
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][DANGER][PROBLEM][EMOTION][CHARACTERIZATION][PERSPECTIVE][CONTEXT][GHOST]"The speech of the poor ghost was not very eloquent, but his eyes had anintense, eager glare, which was terrible. Something--pity, fear, I donot know what--compelled me. I decided to do without that white and goldevening cloak. Instead, I gave $72.50 to the ghost and took from him a
[W BOB HOLLAND][EMOTION][SURPRISE]receipt for the sum, signed J. Billington Price. Then he smiledcontentedly, thanked me with emotion, and returned to chair numberthirteen. Several times on the journey, although I did not perceive himagain, I felt dazed. When the train arrived at New York, and I, with the
[W BOB HOLLAND][PERSPECTIVE][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][FLASHBACK][METAPHOR][CONTEXT][CONFLICT]other passengers, dismounted, it seemed to me that a strong hand passedunder my elbow, steadying me down the steps. As I walked the length ofthe station my bag--not heavy at any time--appeared to becomeweightless. I believe that the parlor-car ghost walked beside me,carrying the bag, whose handle still remained in my other hand. Indeed,once or twice I thought I felt the touch of cold fingers against mine.
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][CONFLICT]Since then I have no reason to suppose that the poor ghost is not atrest. I hope he is."But I never expected nor wished for the blue denims. The next day,however, a dray belonging to a great wholesale house backed up to ourdoor and delivered a case of denims, with a receipted bill for the same.What was I to do? I could not go about selling blue denims; I could not
[W BOB HOLLAND][PERSPECTIVE][PROBLEM][EXPOSITION][CHARACTERIZATION][CONTEXT][PLOT][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][ACTION]give them away without exciting comment. So I furnished the cottage withthem--and you know the effect on my complexion. Pity me, dear! Andcredit me, frivolous woman as I am, with having saved a soul at theexpense of my own vanity. My story is told. What do you think about
[W BOB HOLLAND][GHOST]it?"GHOST OF BUCKSTOWN INN.BY ARNOLD M. ANDERSON.
[W BOB HOLLAND][CHARACTER][CHARACTERIZATION][FLASHBACK][CONTEXT]Several travel-worn drummers sat in the lobby exchanging yarns. It wasRodney Green’s turn, and he looked wise and began his tale.[DIALOGUE]"I don’t claim, by any means, that the belief in ghosts is a generalthing in Arkansas, but I do say that I had an experience out there a fewyears ago."It was late in the fall, and I happened to be in the village ofBuckstown, which desecrates a very limited portion of the State. Thetown is about as small and dirty a place as ever I saw, and theBuckstown Inn is not much above the general character of the place. Theregion is inhabited by natives who still cling to all sorts of foolishsuperstitions. The inn, in the ante-bellum days, was kept by one who was
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][DANGER][METAPHOR][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][CHARACTER][CHARACTERIZATION][MONSTER]said to be the meanest and most crabbed of mortals. The old demon was asmiserly as he was mean, and all his narrow life he hoarded his filthylucre with fiendish greed. Report had it also that he had even murderedhis patrons in their beds for their money. What the facts actually wereI don’t know, but even to this day the old inn is held in suspicion. A
[W BOB HOLLAND][CHARACTER][FLASHBACK][PERSPECTIVE][TRANSITION][HORROR]lingering effect of former horrors still clouds its memory.[DIALOGUE]"The present proprietor, Bunk Watson--his real name is Bunker, Ibelieve--is an altogether different sort of chap--a Southern type, infact--one of those shiftless, heedless, happy-go-lucky mortals who lovesstrong whiskey and who chews an enormous quid of black tobacco andsmokes a corncob pipe at the same time."When the former keeper ‘shuffled off,’ his property fell to a distantrelative, the present keeper, who, with his family, immediately moved infrom a neighboring hamlet and took possession. It was well known thatthe old proprietor had accumulated considerable wealth during hissojourn among the living, but all efforts to discover any treasure uponthe premises had failed, and now the idea of ever finding it waspractically given up. As far as Bunk was concerned, the matter troubledhim little. He had a hard-working wife who ran things the best she couldunder the circumstances, and saw that his meals were forthcoming attheir respective intervals. What more could he wish? Why should he care
[W BOB HOLLAND][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][DEATH][GHOST]if there was a treasure buried upon his place? Indeed, it would havebeen a sore puzzle for him to know what to do with a fortune unlessperhaps his wife came to his aid."Among the stories that hovered in the history of the Buckstown Inn wasone which involved a ghost. In the room where the former keeper had diedpeculiar noises were heard at unearthly hours: sighing, moaning, and, infact, all the other indications which point to the existence of ghosts,were said to be present. On account of this the chamber had long since
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][HAUNTED HOUSE]been abandoned."I listened with keen interest to the wonderful tales about the hauntedroom, and then suddenly resolved to investigate--to sleep in thatchamber that very night and see for myself all that was to be seen. Itold Buck of my purpose. He shook his head, shrugged his shoulders, butinstead of warning me and offering a flood of protests, as I expected,he merely took his pipe from his mouth, let fly a quart or so ofyellowish juice from between a pair of brown-stained lips, and, openingone corner of his wide mouth, lazily called out: ‘Jane.’ His wife
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][HORROR]appeared, and he intimated that I should settle the matter with the ‘oldwoman.’ The prospect of a fee persuaded the wife, and off she went toarrange for my bed in that ill-fated room."At nine o’clock that evening I bid the family good-night, took mycandle, ascended the rickety stairs and entered the chamber of horrors.The atmosphere was heavy and had a peculiar odor that was not at allpleasing. However, I latched the door and was soon in bed. Having
[W BOB HOLLAND][GHOST]propped myself up with pillows, I was prepared to await the coming ofthe ghost.[DIALOGUE]"Overhead the dusty rafters, which once had experienced the sensation ofbeing whitewashed, but which were now a dirty, yellowish color, werehung with a fantastic array of cobwebs. The flickering light of thecandle reflected upon the walls and against the ceiling a pyramid ofgrotesque shapes, and with this effect being continually disturbed bythe swaying cobwebs, the whole caused the room to appear rather ghostlyafter all, and especially so to an imaginative mind."I waited and waited for hours, it seemed, but still no ghost. Perhapsit was afraid of my candle light, so I blew it out. No sooner had I donethis and settled back in bed again than a white hand appeared throughthe door, then a whole figure--at last the ghost had come, a white andsheeted ghost!"It had come right through the door, although it was locked, and now itadvanced toward the bed. Raising its long, white arm, it pointed a bony
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][FLASHBACK][DANGER][GHOST]finger at me, and then commanded: ‘Come with me!’ Thereupon it turned tothe door, while instantly I jumped out of bed to follow. Some unseenpower compelled me to obey. The door flew open and the ghost led me downthe stairs, through long halls into the cellar, through mysteriousunderground corridors, upstairs again, in and out rooms which I neverdreamed were to be found in that old rambling inn. Finally, through a
[W BOB HOLLAND][DEATH][CHARACTER][FLASHBACK][METAPHOR][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][HORROR]small door in the rear, we left the house. I was in my sleepinggarments, but no matter, I had to follow.[DIALOGUE]"The white form, with a slow and measured tread and as silent as death,led the way into the orchard. There, under a tree at the farther end, itpointed to the ground, and in the same ghostly tones before used, said:"‘Here you will find a great treasure buried.’
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][GHOST]"The ghost then disappeared, and I saw it no more. I stood dazed andtrembling. Upon recovering my wits I started to dig, but the chill ofthe night air and the scantiness of my night robes made such laborimpracticable. So I decided to leave some mark to identify the place andcome around again at daybreak. I reached up and broke off a limb.
[W BOB HOLLAND][GHOST]Overcome with my night’s exertions I slept the next morning until a loudrapping on my door and a croaking voice warned me that it was noon.[DIALOGUE]"I had intended to leave Buckstown Inn that day, but, prompted bycuriosity and anxious to investigate, I unpacked my gripsack for acomfortable stay."You must understand that this was my first experience with a ghost, andI feared I might never see another.[DIALOGUE]"At breakfast my landlady waited on me in silence, though once Idetected her eyes following me with a peculiar expression. She wanted toask me how I enjoyed the night, but I would not gratify her byvolunteering a word."My host was more outspoken.[DIALOGUE]"‘Reckon ye didn’t get much sleep,’ said he, with a queer smile."‘Did you hear anything?’ I asked."‘Well, I did--ye-es,’ he said, with a drawl. ‘But ye didn’t disturb meany. I knew ye’d hev trouble when ye went in thet room ter sleep.’
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][ACTION][CONFLICT][TRANSITION]"That afternoon I slipped out to the tree. But to my amazement I foundthat the twig I had broken from the branches was gone. Finally I foundunder the lower trunk of an apple tree an open place from which a smallbranch had evidently been wrested. But on looking further, I discoveredthat every apple tree in the orchard had been similarly disfigured.
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][EMOTION][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][GHOST][DIALOGUE]"‘More mysterious than ever,’ I said; ‘but to-night shall decide.’"That night I pleaded weariness, which no one seemed inclined toquestion, and sought my couch earlier.[DIALOGUE]"‘Goin’ ter try it again?’ asked my host."‘Yes; and I’ll stay all winter but what I’ll get even with that ghost,’I said.
[W BOB HOLLAND][FLASHBACK][GHOST][DIALOGUE]"That night I kept the candle burning until midnight, when I blew itout."Instantly the room was flooded with a soft light, and at the foot ofthe bed stood my ghost, the identical ghost of last night."Again the bony finger beckoned and a sepulchral voice whispered,‘Follow me!’ I sprang from the bed, but the figure darted ahead of me.It flew through the doorway and down the stairs, and I after it. At the
[W BOB HOLLAND][TRANSITION][ACTION][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][DANGER][EMOTION][PROBLEM][GHOST]foot of the staircase an unseen hand reached forward and caught my footand I fell sprawling headlong."But in a second I was on my feet and pursuing the ghost. It had gainedon me a few yards, but I was quicker, and just as we reached the outsidedoor I nearly touched its robes. They sent a chill through my frame, andI nearly gave up the pursuit.
[W BOB HOLLAND][GHOST][DIALOGUE]"As it passed through the doorway it turned and gave me one look, and Icaught the same malignant light in its eyes that I remembered from thenight before."In the open orchard I felt sure I could catch it.[DIALOGUE]"But my ghost had no intention of allowing me any such opportunity. Tomy disgust, it darted backward and into the house, slamming the door inmy face."In my frenzy of fear and chagrin I threw myself against the oaken doorwith such force that its rusty old hinges yielded and I landed in thebig front room of the inn just in time to see the white skirts of theghost flit up the stairs."Upstairs I flew after it, and into an old chamber. There, huddled in acorner, I saw it. In the minute’s delay it had secured a lighted candleand, as I entered, it advanced to daunt me with bony arm upraised to agreat height.
[W BOB HOLLAND][PERSPECTIVE][DIALOGUE]"‘Caught!’ I cried, throwing my arms around the figure. And I had madethe acquaintance of a real live ghost."The white robes fell, and I saw revealed my hostess of Buckstown Inn.[DIALOGUE]"Next morning, when I threatened to call the police, she confessed to methat she masqueraded as a ghost to draw visitors to the out-of-the-wayold place, and that she found its tale of being haunted highlyprofitable to her."THE BURGLAR’S GHOST.I am not an imaginative man, and no one who knows me can say that I haveever indulged in sentimental ideas upon any subject. I am ratherpredisposed, in fact, to look at everything from a purely practicalstandpoint, and this quality has been further developed in me by thefact that for twenty years I have been an active member of the detectivepolice force at Westford, a large town in one of our most importantmanufacturing districts. A policeman, as most people will readilybelieve, has to deal with so much practical life that he has smallopportunity for developing other than practical qualities, and he ismore apt to believe in tangible things than in ideas of a somewhatsuperstitious nature. However, I was once under the firm conviction that
[W BOB HOLLAND][RELIEF][PERSPECTIVE][GHOST]I had been largely helped up the ladder of life by the ghost of a oncewell-known burglar. I have told the story to many, and have heard itcommented upon in various fashions. Whether the comments were satiricalor practical, it made no difference to me; I had a firm faith at thattime in the truth of my tale.Eighteen years ago I was a plain clothes officer at Westford. I was then
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][PERSPECTIVE]twenty-three years of age, and very anxious about two matters. First andforemost I desired promotion; second, I wished to be married. Of courseI was more eager about the second than the first, because my sweetheart,Alice Moore, was one of the prettiest and cleverest girls in the town;but I put promotion first for the simple reason that with me promotionmust come before marriage. Knowing this, I was always on the lookout fora chance of distinguishing myself, and I paid such attention to myduties that my superiors began to notice me, and foretold a successfulcareer for me in the future.
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE]One evening in the last week of September, 1873, I was sitting in mylodgings wondering what I could do to earn the promotion which I soearnestly wished for. Things were quiet just then in Westford, and I amafraid I half wished that something dreadful might occur if I only couldhave a share in it. I was pursuing this train of thought when I suddenlyheard a voice say, [DIALOGUE]"Good evening, officer."I turned sharply around. It was almost dusk and my lamp was not lighted.
[W BOB HOLLAND][EMOTION]For all that, I could see clearly enough a man who was sitting by achest of drawers that stood between the door and the window. His chairstood between the drawers and the door, and I concluded that he hadquietly entered my room and seated himself before addressing me.[DIALOGUE]"Good evening!" I replied. [DIALOGUE]"I didn’t hear you come in."He laughed when I said that--a low, chuckling, rather sly laugh. [DIALOGUE]"No,"he said, "I dessay not, officer. I’m a very quiet sort of person. You
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE]might say, in fact, noiseless. Just so."I looked at him narrowly, feeling considerably surprised and astonishedat his presence. He was a thickly built man, with a square face andheavy chin. His nose was small, but aggressive; his eyes were little and
[W BOB HOLLAND]overshadowed by heavy eyebrows; I could see them twinkle when he spoke.As for his dress, it was in keeping with his face.He wore a rough suit of woolen or frieze; a thick, gayly colored Belcherneckerchief encircled his bull-like throat, and in his big hands hecontinually twirled and twisted a fur cap, made apparently out of theskin of some favorite dog. As he sat there smiling at me and sayingnothing, it made me feel uncomfortable.
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][PERSPECTIVE][TRANSITION][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][DIALOGUE]"What do you want with me?" I asked.[DIALOGUE]"Just a little matter o’ business," he answered.[DIALOGUE]"You should have gone to the office," I said. [DIALOGUE]"We’re not supposed to dobusiness at home."[DIALOGUE]"Right you are, guv’nor," he replied; "but I wanted to see you. It’s youthat’s got to do my job. If I’d ha’ seen the superintendent he mightha’ put somebody else on to it. That wouldn’t ha’ suited me. You see,
[W BOB HOLLAND][EXPOSITION][CONTEXT][SURPRISE][PROBLEM]officer, you’re young, and nat’rally eager-like for promotion. Eh?[DIALOGUE]""What is it you want?[DIALOGUE]" I inquired again."Ain’t you eager to be promoted?[DIALOGUE]" he reiterated. "Ain’t you now,officer?"I saw no reason why I should conceal the fact, even from this strangevisitor. I admitted that I was eager for promotion.
[W BOB HOLLAND][RELIEF][EMOTION][SETTING][TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][RESOLUTION][DIALOGUE]"Ah!" he said, with a satisfied smile; "I’m glad o’ that. It’ll make youall the keener. Now, officer, you listen to me. I’m a-goin’ to put youon to a nice little job. Ah! I dessay you’ll be a sergeant before long,
[W BOB HOLLAND][EXPOSITION][PERSPECTIVE][CONFLICT][TRANSITION]you will. You’ll be complimented and praised for your clever conduck inthis ’ere affair. Mark my words if you ain’t.[DIALOGUE]""Out with it,[DIALOGUE]" I said, fancying I saw through the man’s meaning. "You’re
[W BOB HOLLAND][PROBLEM]going to split on some of your pals, I suppose, and you’ll want areward.[DIALOGUE]"He shook his head. "A reward,[DIALOGUE]" he said, "wouldn’t be no use to me atall--no, not if it was a thousand pounds. No, it ain’t nothing to dowith reward. But now, officer, did you ever hear of Light Toed Jim?"Light Toed Jim! I should have been a poor detective if I had not. Why,
[W BOB HOLLAND][CHARACTER][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][FLASHBACK][DANGER][MONSTER]the man known under that sobriquet was one of the cleverest burglars andthieves in England, and had enjoyed such a famous career that his namewas a household word. At that moment there was an additional interestattached to him. He had been convicted of burglary at the Northminsterassizes in 1871, and sentenced to ten years’ penal servitude. Afterserving nearly two years of his time he had escaped from Portland,getting away in such clever fashion that he had never been heard ofsince. Where he was no one could say; but lately there had been a strong
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][CONTEXT][CONFLICT][FLASHBACK]suspicion among the police that Light Toed Jim was at his old tricksagain.[DIALOGUE]"Light Toed Jim!" I repeated. [DIALOGUE]"I should think so. Why, what do you knowabout him?"He smiled and nodded his head. [DIALOGUE]"Light Toed Jim," said he, "is inWestford at this ’ere hidentical moment. Listen to me, officer. Light
[W BOB HOLLAND][CHARACTER][PROBLEM]Toed Jim is a-goin’ to crack a crib to-night. Said crib is the mansionof Miss Singleton, that ’ere rich old lady as lives out on the MapletonRoad. You know her--awfully rich, with naught but women servants andanimals about the place. There’s some very valyable plate there. That’s
[W BOB HOLLAND][TRANSITION][ACTION][CHARACTER]what Light Toed Jim’s after. He’ll get in through the scullery windowabout 1 a. m., then he’ll pass through the back and front kitchens andinto the butler’s pantry--only it’s a butleress, ’cos there ain’t no menat all--and there he’ll set to work on the safe. Some of his late pals
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][METAPHOR][TRANSITION]in Portland give him the tip about this ’ere job.[DIALOGUE]""How did you come to hear of it?[DIALOGUE]" I asked."Never mind, guv’nor. You wouldn’t understand. Now, I wants you to be up
[W BOB HOLLAND][METAPHOR][EXPOSITION][ACTION][WEAPON][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][RELIEF][RESOLUTION][PLOT][PERSPECTIVE][CONTEXT][CLIMAX][CHARACTERIZATION]there to-night and to nab Light Toed Jim red-handed, so to speak. It’llmean promotion for you, and it’ll suit me down to the ground. You wantsto be about and to watch him enter. Then follow him and dog him. And be
[W BOB HOLLAND]armed, officer, for Jim’ll fight like a tiger if you don’t draw histeeth first.[DIALOGUE]""Now, look here, my man,[DIALOGUE]" said I, "this is all very well, but it’s allirregular. You must just tell me who you are and how you come to be inLight Toed Jim’s secrets, and I’ll put it down in black and white."I turned away from him to get my writing materials. I was not half aminute with my back to him, but when I turned round he was gone. Thedoor was shut, but I had heard no sound from it either opening orshutting. Quick as thought I darted to it, tore it wide open, and looked
[W BOB HOLLAND]down the narrow staircase. There was no one there. I ran hastilydownstairs into the passage, and found my landlady, Mrs. Marriner,standing at the open door with a female friend. [DIALOGUE]"Mrs. Marriner," I said,breaking in upon their conversation, [DIALOGUE]"which way did that man go who camedownstairs just now?"Mrs. Marriner looked at me strangely. "There ain’t been no man come
[W BOB HOLLAND]downstairs, Mr. Parker,[DIALOGUE]" said she; "leastways, not this goodthree-quarters of an hour, which me and Missis Higgins ’ere, as ’avecome out to take an airing, her having been ironin’ all this blessedday, has been standin’ ’ere all the time and ain’t never seen a soul.[DIALOGUE]""Nonsense,[DIALOGUE]" I said. "A man came down from my room just now--the man yousent up twenty minutes since.[DIALOGUE]"Mrs. Marriner looked at me with an expression betokening the mostprofound astonishment. Mrs. Higgins sighed deeply."Mr. Parker,[DIALOGUE]" said Mrs. Marriner, "sorry am I to say it, sir, but you’reeither intoxicated or else you’re a-sickening for brain fever, sir.There ain’t no person entered this door, in or out, for nigh onto anhour, as me and Missis Higgins ’ere will take our Bible oaths on."I went upstairs and looked in the rooms on either side of mine. The manwas not there. I looked under my bed, and of course he was not there. He
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][EMOTION]must have gone downstairs. But then the women must have seen him. Therewas only one door to the house. I gave it up in despair and began tosmoke my pipe. By the time I had drawn the last whiff I decided that if
[W BOB HOLLAND][PERSPECTIVE]anyone was [DIALOGUE]"intoxicated," it was probably Mrs. Marriner and Mrs.Higgins, and that my strange visitor had departed by the door. I was notgoing to believe that he had anything supernatural about him.I had no duty that night, and as the hours wore on I found myself sternin my resolve to go up to Miss Singleton’s house and see what I couldmake out of my informant’s story. It was my opinion that my late visitorwas a whilom [DIALOGUE]"pal" of Light Toed Jim, and that having become aware ofthe latter’s plot, he had, for some reason of his own, decided to spliton his old chum. Thieves’ disagreement is an honest man’s opportunity,
[W BOB HOLLAND][WEAPON][PROBLEM][ACTION][DANGER][CONFLICT][SURPRISE]and I determined to solve the truth of the story told me. Lest it shouldcome to nothing, I decided not to report the matter to my chief. If Icould really capture Light Toed Jim, my success would be all the morebrilliant by being suddenly sprung upon the authorities.I made my plan of action rapidly. I took a revolver with me and went up
[W BOB HOLLAND][RELIEF][CONTEXT][PERSPECTIVE][ACTION]to Miss Singleton’s house. Fortunately, I knew the housekeeper there--amiddle-aged, strong-minded woman, not easily frightened, which was agood thing. To her I communicated such information as I considerednecessary. She consented to conceal me in the room where the safe stood.
[W BOB HOLLAND]There was a cupboard close by the safe from which I could command a fullview of the burglar’s operations and pounce upon him at the rightmoment. If only my information was to be relied upon, there was everychance of my capturing the famous burglar.Soon after midnight, when the house was all quiet, I went to the pantryand got into the cupboard, locking myself in. There were two openingsin the panel, through either of which I was able to command a full viewof the room. My position was somewhat cramped, but the time soon passed
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][SUSPENSE][DANGER][PROBLEM]away. My mind was principally occupied in wondering if I was reallyabout to have a chance of distinguishing myself. Somehow, there was anair of unreality about the events of the evening which puzzled me.Suddenly I heard a sound which put me on the alert at once. It was
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][ACTION][DANGER][TRANSITION]nothing more than the creaking of a board or opening of a door wouldmake in a quiet house; but it sounded intensified to my expectant ears.I drew myself up against the door of the cupboard and placed my eye tothe opening in the panel. I had oiled the key of the door, and kept myfingers upon it in readiness to spring upon the burglar at the propermoment. After what seemed some time I saw the gleam of light through thekeyhole of the door opening into the pantry. Then it opened, and a man
[W BOB HOLLAND][TRANSITION][METAPHOR]carrying a small lantern came gently into the room. At first I could seenothing of his face; but when my eyes grew accustomed to the hazy lightI saw that I had been rightly informed, and that the burglar was indeedno other than the famous Light Toed Jim.As I stood there watching him I could not help admiring the cool fashionin which he went to work. He went over to the window and examined it. He
[W BOB HOLLAND][ACTION][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK]tried the door of the cupboard in which I stood concealed. Then helocked the door of the pantry and turned his attention to the safe. Heset his lamp on a chair before the lock and took from his pocket as neatand pretty a collection of tools as ever I saw. With these he wentquietly and swiftly to work.
[W BOB HOLLAND]Light Toed Jim was a somewhat slimly built fellow, with little musculardevelopment about him, while I am a big man with plenty of bone andsinew. If matters had come to a fight between us I could have done whatI pleased with him; but I knew that Jim would not chance a fight.Somewhere about him I felt sure there was a revolver, which he would useon the least provocation. My plan, therefore, was to wait until his backwas bent over the lock of the safe, then to open the cupboard doornoiselessly and fall bodily upon him, pinning him to the ground beneathme.
[W BOB HOLLAND][CLIMAX][ACTION][DANGER][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][WEAPON][PROBLEM]Before long the moment came. He was working steadily away at the lock,his whole attention concentrated on the job. The slight noise of hisdrill was sufficient to drown the faint click of the key in the cupboarddoor. I turned it quickly and tumbled right upon him, driving the toolout of his hands and tumbling him into a heap at the foot of the safe.
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][DANGER][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][WEAPON][EMOTION][ACTION][FLASHBACK]He uttered an exclamation of rage and astonishment as he went down, andimmediately began to wriggle under me like an eel. As I kept him downwith one hand I tried to pull out the handcuffs with the other. Thissomewhat embarrassed me, and the burglar profited by it to pull out asharp knife. He had worked himself round on his back, and before Irealized what he was after he was hacking furiously at me with his keen,dagger-like blade. Then I realized that we were going to have a fight
[W BOB HOLLAND][ACTION][CONFLICT][DANGER]for it, and prepared myself. He tried to run the knife into my side. Iwarded it off, but the blade caught the fleshy part of my left arm and Ifelt a warm stream of blood spurt out.That maddened me, and I seized one of the steel drills lying near athand, and hit my man such a blow over the temple that he collapsed atonce, and lay as if dead. I put the handcuffs on him instantly, and, to
[W BOB HOLLAND][ACTION][EMOTION][WEAPON][PERSPECTIVE][TRANSITION][RELIEF][CONFLICT][SURPRISE]make matters still more certain, I secured his ankles. Then I rose andlooked at my arm. The knife had made a nasty gash, and the blood wasflowing freely, but it was not serious; and when the housekeeper, whohad just then appeared on the scene, had bandaged it, I went out andsecured the help of the first policeman I met in conveying Light ToedJim to the office.I felt a proud man when I made my report to the inspector.
[W BOB HOLLAND][DIALOGUE]"Light Toed Jim?" said he. [DIALOGUE]"What, James Bland? Nonsense, Parker." But Itook him to the cells where Jim was being attended to by the doctor.[DIALOGUE]"You’re right, Parker," he said. [DIALOGUE]"That’s the man. Well, this will be afine thing for you."After a time, feeling a little exhausted, I went home to try and getsome sleep. The surgeon had attended to my arm, and told me it was but asuperficial wound. It felt sore enough in spite of that.
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][EMOTION]I had no sooner reached my lodgings than I saw sitting in my easy-chairthe strange man who had called upon me earlier in the evening. He roseto his feet when I entered. I stared at him in utter astonishment.[DIALOGUE]"Well, guv’nor," said he, [DIALOGUE]"I see you’ve done it. You’ve got him squareand fair, I reckon?"[DIALOGUE]"Yes," I said.[DIALOGUE]"Ah!" he said, with a sigh of complete satisfaction. "Then I’msatisfied. Yes, I don’t know as how there’s aught more I could say. I
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][FLASHBACK][METAPHOR][TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][PROBLEM][CLIMAX][SURPRISE]reckon as how Light Toed Jim an’ me is quits.[DIALOGUE]"I was determined to find out who this man was this time. "Sit down,[DIALOGUE]" Isaid. "There’s a question or two I must ask you. Just let me get my coat
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][TRANSITION]off and I’ll talk to you.[DIALOGUE]" I took my coat off and went over to the bedto lay it down. "Now then," I began, and looked around at him. I said nomore, being literally struck dumb. The man was gone!
[W BOB HOLLAND][DANGER][SURPRISE][PROBLEM]I began to feel uncomfortable. I ran hastily downstairs, only to findthe outer door locked and bolted, as I had left it a few minutesbefore. I went back, utterly nonplussed. For an hour I pondered thematter over, but could neither make head nor tail of it.
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][DANGER]When I went down to the office next morning I was informed that theburglar wanted to see me. I went to his cell, where he was lying in bedwith his head bandaged. I had hit him pretty hard, as it turned out, andit was probable he would have to lie on the sick list for some days.[DIALOGUE]"Well, guv’nor," said he, [DIALOGUE]"you’d the best of me last night. You hit merather hard that time."[DIALOGUE]"I was sorry to have to do it, my man," I answered. [DIALOGUE]"You would havestabbed me if you could."[DIALOGUE]"Yes," he said, "I should. But I say, guv’nor, come a bit closer; I want
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][FLASHBACK][DANGER][SUSPENSE][PERSPECTIVE]to ask you a question. How did you know I was on that little job lastnight? For, s’elp me, there wasn’t a soul knew a breath about it butmyself. I hadn’t no pals, never talked to anybody about it, neverthought aloud about it, as I knows on. How came you to spot it,
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][GHOST]guv’nor?[DIALOGUE]"There was no one else in the cell with us, and I thought I might findout something about my mysterious visitor of the night before. "It was apal of yours who gave me the information,[DIALOGUE]" I said."Can’t be, guv’nor. No use telling me that. I ain’t got no
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][CHARACTERIZATION][DANGER][HORROR]pals--leastways not in this job.[DIALOGUE]""Did you ever know a man like this?" I described my visitor. As Iproceeded, Light Toed Jim’s face assumed an expression of real terror.Whatever color there was in it faded away. I never saw a man look more
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][CHARACTER][PROBLEM][DANGER][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE][HORROR]thoroughly frightened. [DIALOGUE]"Yes, yes," he said, eagerly. "In course I knowwho it is. Why, it’s Barksea Bill, as I pal’d with at one time--and whatdid he say, guv’nor--that he owed me a grudge? That we was quits at
[W BOB HOLLAND][DEATH][FLASHBACK][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][DANGER][GHOST]last? Right you are, ’cos he did owe me a grudge. I treated Bill veryshabby--very shabby, indeed, and he swore solemn he’d have his revenge.On’y, guv’nor, what you see wasn’t Barksea Bill at all, but his ghost,’cos Barksea Bill’s been dead and buried this three year."
[W BOB HOLLAND]I was naturally very much exercised in my mind over this weirddevelopment of the affair, and I used to think about it long after LightToed Jim had once more retired to the seclusion of Portland. While hewas in charge at Westford I tried more than once to worm some moreinformation out of him about the defunct Barksea Bill, but with nosuccess. He would say no more than that [DIALOGUE]"Bill was dead and buried thisthree year;" and with that I had to be content. Gradually I came to havea firm belief that I had indeed been visited by Barksea Bill’s ghost,and I often told the story to brother officers, and sometimes got welllaughed at. That, however, mattered little to me; I felt sure that any
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][FLASHBACK][GHOST]man who had gone through the same experience would have had the samebeliefs.Of course I got my promotion and was soon afterward married. Things wentwell with me, and I was lifted from one step to another. In my secretmind I was always sure I owed my first rise to the burglar’s ghost, andI should have continued to think so but for an incident which occurredjust five years after my capture of Light Toed Jim.
[W BOB HOLLAND][EMOTION][HORROR]I had occasion to travel to Sheffield from Westford, and had to changetrains at Leeds. The carriage I stepped into was occupied by a solitaryindividual, who turned his face to me as I sat down. Though dressed inmore respectable fashion, I immediately recognized the man who hadvisited me so mysteriously at my lodgings. My first feeling was one offear, and I daresay my face showed it, for the man laughed.
[W BOB HOLLAND][GHOST][DIALOGUE]"Hallo, guv’nor," said he; [DIALOGUE]"I see you knew me as soon as you come in.You owes a deal to me, guv’nor; now, don’t you, eh?"[DIALOGUE]"Look here, my man," I said, [DIALOGUE]"I’ve been taking you for a ghost thesefive years past. Now just tell me how you got in and out of my room thatnight, will you?"He laughed long and loud at that. [DIALOGUE]"A ghost?" said he. "Well, if thatain’t a good un! Why, easy enough, guv’nor. I was a-lodging for a day or
[W BOB HOLLAND][TRANSITION][ACTION][PERSPECTIVE][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][VAMPIRE]two in the same house. It’s easy enough, when you know how, to open adoor very quiet and to slip out, too.[DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE]""But I followed you sharp, and looked for you.""Ay, guv’nor; but you looked down, and I had gone up! You should ha’come up to the attics, and there you’d ha’ found me. So you took me for
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][EMOTION][PROBLEM][DANGER][FLASHBACK][MURDER]a ghost? Well, I’m blowed.[DIALOGUE]"I told him what Light Toed Jim had said in the cell."Ay,[DIALOGUE]" said he, "I dessay, guv’nor. You see, ’twas this way--it weren’tJim’s fault as I wasn’t dead. He tried to murder me, guv’nor, he did,and left me a-lying for dead. So I ses to myself when I comes round that
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][PROBLEM]I’d pay him out sooner or later. But after that I quit the profession,Jim’s nasty conduck havin’ made me sick of it. So I went in for honestwork at my old trade, which was draining and pipe repairing. I was on ajob o’ that sort in Westford, near Miss Singleton’s house, when I seeLight Toed Jim. I had a hidea what he was up to, havin’ heard o’ the
[W BOB HOLLAND][FLASHBACK][PERSPECTIVE][GHOST]plate, and I watches him one or two nights, and gets a notion ’ow he wasgoing to work the job. Then, o’ course, you being a officer and close athand I splits on him--and that’s all.[DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE]""But you had got the time and details correct?""Why, o’ course, guv’nor. I was an old hand--served many years atPortland, I have, and I knew just how Jim would work it, after seeinghis perlim’nary observations. But a ghost! Ha, ha, ha! Why, guv’nor, you
[W BOB HOLLAND][METAPHOR][SURPRISE]must ha’ been a very green young officer in them days!"Perhaps I was. At any rate I learned a lesson from the ci-devant BarkseaBill--namely, that in searching a house it is always advisable to lookup as well as down.A PHANTOM TOE.
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][SURPRISE]I am not a superstitious man, far from it, but despite all my efforts tothe contrary I could not help thinking, directly I had taken a survey ofmy chamber, that I should never quit it without going through a strangeadventure. There was something in its immense size, heaviness and gloomthat seemed to annihilate at one blow all my resolute skepticism asregards supernatural visitations. It appeared to me totally impossibleto go into that room and disbelieve in ghosts.The fact is, I had incautiously partaken at supper of that favoriteDutch dish, sauerkraut, and I suppose it had disagreed with me and putstrange fancies into my head. Be this as it may I only know that after
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE]parting with my friend for the night I gradually worked myself up intosuch a state of fidgetiness that at last I wasn’t sure whether I hadn’tbecome a ghost myself.[DIALOGUE]"Supposing," ruminated I, [DIALOGUE]"supposing the landlord himself should be apractical robber and should have taken the lock and bolt from off thisdoor for the purpose of entering here in the dead of the night,abstracting all my property, and perhaps murdering me! I thought the doghad a very cutthroat air about him." Now, I had never had any such ideauntil that moment, for my host was a fat (all Dutchmen are fat),stupid-looking fellow, who I don’t believe had sense enough tounderstand what a robbery or murder meant, but somehow or other,whenever we have anything really to annoy us (and it certainly was notpleasant to go to bed in a strange place without being able to fastenone’s door), we are sure to aggravate it by myriads of chimeras of ourown brain.So, on the present occasion, in the midst of a thousand disagreeablereveries, some of the most wild absurdity, I jumped very gloomily intobed, having first put out my candle (for total darkness was farpreferable to its flickering, ghostly light, which transformed ratherthan revealed objects), and soon fell asleep, perfectly tired out withmy day’s riding.How long I lay asleep I don’t know, but I suddenly awoke from adisagreeable dream of cutthroats, ghosts and long, winding passages in ahaunted inn. An indescribable feeling, such as I never beforeexperienced, hung upon me. It seemed as if every nerve in my body had a
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][HORROR]hundred spirits tickling it, and this was accompanied by so great a heatthat, inwardly cursing mine host’s sauerkraut and wondering how theDutchmen could endure such poison, I was forced to sit up in bed tocool myself. The whole of the room was profoundly dark, excepting at oneplace, where the moonlight, falling through a crevice in the shutters,threw a straight line of about an inch or so thick upon thefloor--clear, sharp and intensely brilliant against the darkness. Ileave you to conceive my horror when, upon looking at this said line oflight, I saw there a naked human toe--nothing more.For the first instant I thought the vision must be some effect ofmoonlight, then that I was only half awake and could not see distinctly.
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][DANGER][CHARACTER][METAPHOR][PERSPECTIVE][HORROR]So I rubbed my eyes two or three times and looked again. Still there wasthe accursed thing--plain, distinct, immovable--marblelike in itsfixedness and rigidity, but in everything else horribly human.I am not an easily frightened man. No one who has traveled so much andseen so much and been exposed to so many dangers as I, can be, but therewas something so mysterious and unusual in the appearance of this singletoe that for a short time I could not think what to be at, so I didnothing but stare at it in a state of utter bewilderment.
[W BOB HOLLAND]At length, however, as the toe did not vanish under my steady gaze, Ithought I might as well change my tactics, and remembering that allmidnight invaders, be they thieves, ghosts or devils, dislike nothingso much as a good noise I shouted out in a loud voice:[DIALOGUE]"Who’s there?"The toe immediately disappeared in the darkness.Almost simultaneously with my words I leaped out of bed and rushedtoward the place where I had beheld the strange appearance. The nextinstant I ran against something and felt an iron grip round my body.After this I have no distinct recollection of what occurred, exceptingthat a fearful struggle ensued between me and my unseen opponent; thatevery now and then we were violently hurled to the floor, from which wealways rose again in an instant, locked in a deadly embrace; that wetugged and strained and pulled and pushed, I in the convulsive andfrantic energy of a fight for life, he (for by this time I haddiscovered that the intruder was a human being) actuated by some passionof which I was ignorant; that we whirled round and round, cheek to cheekand arm to arm, in fierce contest, until the room appeared to whiz roundwith us, and that at least a dozen people (my fellow traveler amongthem), roused, I suppose, by our repeated falls, came pouring into theroom with lights and showed me struggling with a man having nothing onbut a shirt, whose long, tangled hair and wild, unsettled eyes told mehe was insane. And then, for the first time, I became aware that I had
[W BOB HOLLAND][WEAPON][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][SURPRISE][CHARACTERIZATION][CONTEXT][MURDER]received in the conflict several gashes from a knife, which my opponentstill held in his hand.To conclude my story in a few words (for I daresay all of you by thistime are getting very tired), it turned out that my midnight visitor wasa madman who was being conveyed to a lunatic asylum at The Hague, andthat he and his keeper had been obliged to stop at Delft on their way.The poor fellow had contrived during the night to escape from hiskeeper, who had carelessly forgotten to lock the door of his chamber,and with that irresistible desire to shed blood peculiar to many insanepeople had possessed himself of a pocketknife belonging to the man whohad charge of him, entered my room, which was most likely the only onein the house unfastened, and was probably meditating the fatal strokewhen I saw his toe in the moonlight, the rest of his body being hiddenin the shade.After this terrible freak of his he was watched with much greaterstrictness, but I ought to observe, as some excuse for the keeper’snegligence, that this was the first act of violence he had everattempted.
[W BOB HOLLAND][PERSPECTIVE][GHOST]MRS. DAVENPORT’S GHOST.BY FREDERICK F. SCHRADER.Dear readers, do you agree with Hamlet? Do you believe that there is
[W BOB HOLLAND][DANGER][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][CONFLICT][EXPOSITION][HORROR]more between heaven and earth than we dream of in our philosophy? Doesit seem possible to you that Eliphas Levy conjured up the shade ofApollonius of Tyana, the prophet of the Magii, in a London hotel, andthat the great sage, William Crookes, drank his tea at breakfast severaldays a week, for months in succession, in the society of thematerialized spirit of a young lady, attired in white linen, with afeather turban on her head?Do not laugh! Panic would seize you in the presence even of a turbanedspirit, and the grotesque spectacle would but intensify your terror. As
[W BOB HOLLAND][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][EMOTION][SURPRISE][DANGER][PERSPECTIVE][DEATH][MURDER]for me, I did not laugh last night on reading an account in a New Yorknewspaper of a criminal trial that will probably terminate in the deathpenalty of the accused.It is a sad case. I shudder as I transcribe the records of the trialfrom the testimony of the hotel waiter, who heard the conversation ofthe two confederates through a keyhole, and of forty thoroughlycredible witnesses, who testified to the same facts. What would be myfeelings if I had seen the beautiful victim with the gaping wound in herbreast, into which she dipped her finger to mark the brow of hermurderer?
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][SURPRISE]I.About three o’clock on the afternoon of February 3, Professor Davenportand Miss Ida Soutchotte, a very pale and delicate young girl, who hadsubmitted to the tests of Professor Davenport for a number of years,were finishing their dinner in their room in the second story of a NewYork hotel. Professor Benjamin Davenport was a celebrity, but it wassaid that he owed his fame to somewhat questionable means. The leadingspiritualists did not repose the confidence in him that manifestlymarked their regard for William Crookes or Daniel Douglas Home.
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][CHARACTER][DIALOGUE]"Greedy and unscrupulous mediums," the author of Spiritualism in Americathinks, [DIALOGUE]"are to blame for the most bitter attacks to which our cause hasbeen exposed. When the materializations do not take place as quickly ascircumstances require, they resort to trickery and fraud to extricatethemselves from a dilemma."Professor Benjamin Davenport belonged to these [DIALOGUE]"versatile" mediums.Aside from this, queer stories were afloat about him. He was secretlyaccused of highway robbery in South America, cheating at cards in thegambling houses of San Francisco, and the overhasty use of firearmstoward persons who had never offended him. It was said almost openly,that the professor’s wife had died from abuse and grief at hisinfidelity. But in spite of these annoying rumors, Mr. Davenport, byvirtue of his skill as a fraud and fakir, continued to exercise a greatdeal of influence upon certain plain and simple-minded folks, whom itwas impossible to convince that they had not touched the materializedspirits of their brothers, mothers, or sisters through the agency of hiswonderful power. His professional success received material accession
[W BOB HOLLAND]from his swarthy, Mephisto-like countenance, his deep, fiery eyes, hislarge curved nose, the cynical expression of his mouth, and the lofty,almost prophetic tone of his words.When the waiter had made his last visit--he did not go far--thefollowing conversation took place in the room:[DIALOGUE]"There is to be a seance this evening at the residence of Mrs. Harding,"began the medium. [DIALOGUE]"Quite a number of influential people will be there,and two or three millionaires. Conceal under your skirt the blondewoman’s wig and the white material in which the spirits usually maketheir appearance."[DIALOGUE]"Very well," replied Ida Soutchotte, in a resigned tone.The waiter heard her pace the room. After a pause, she asked:
[W BOB HOLLAND][DANGER][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][EMOTION][DIALOGUE]"Whose spirit are you going to control this evening, Benjamin?"The waiter heard a loud, brutal laugh and the chair groaning beneath theweight of the demonstrative professor.[DIALOGUE]"Guess."[DIALOGUE]"How should I know?" she asked.[DIALOGUE]"I am going to conjure up the spirit of my dead wife."And another burst of laughter issued from the room, full of sinisterlevity. A cry of terror burst from Ida’s lips. A muffled sound indicatedto the eavesdropper at the door that she was dragging herself to thefeet of the professor.[DIALOGUE]"Benjamin, Benjamin! don’t do it," she sobbed."Why not? They say I broke Mrs. Davenport’s heart. The story is damaging
[W BOB HOLLAND][PROBLEM]my reputation, but it will be forgotten if her spirit should address mein terms of endearment from the other shore in the presence of numerouswitnesses. For you will speak to me tenderly, will you not, Ida?[DIALOGUE]""No, no. You shall not do it; you shall not think of it. Listen to me,
[W BOB HOLLAND]for God’s sake. During the four years that I have been with you I haveobeyed you faithfully and suffered patiently. I have lied and deceived,like you; I learned to imitate the sleep and symptoms of clairvoyants.Tell me, did I ever refuse to serve you, or utter a word of complaint,even when my shoulders bent with the weight of my burden, when youpierced the flesh of my arms with knitting needles? Worse than all this,
[W BOB HOLLAND][DANGER][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][HORROR]I imitated distant voices behind curtains, and made mothers and wivesbelieve that their sons and husbands had come from a better world tocommunicate with them. How often have I performed the most dangerousfeats in parlors with the lamps turned low? Clothed in a shroud or whitemuslin I essayed to represent supernatural forms, whom tear-dimmed eyesrecognized as those of departed dear ones. You do not know what Isuffered at this unhallowed work. You scoff at the mysteries of
[W BOB HOLLAND][DANGER][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][HORROR]eternity. I suffer the torments of an impending retribution. My God! ifsome time the dead whom I counterfeit should rise up before me withuplifted arms and dreadful imprecations! This constant terror has
[W BOB HOLLAND][DANGER][EMOTION][DEATH][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][CHARACTERIZATION][WEAPON][SURPRISE][MURDER]injured my heart--it will kill me. I am consumed by fever. Look howemaciated, how worn-out and downcast I am. But I am under your control.
[W BOB HOLLAND][DANGER][HORROR]Do as you like with me; I am in your power, and I want it to be so. HaveI ever complained? But do not force me to do this thing, Benjamin. Havepity on me for what I have done for you in the past, for what I amsuffering. Do not attempt this mummery; do not compel me to play the
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][DANGER][CONFLICT][METAPHOR]role of your dead wife, who was so tender and beautiful. Oh, what putthat thought into your mind? Spare me, Benjamin, I implore you!"The professor did not laugh again. Amid the confusion of upturned
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][SURPRISE][CHARACTERIZATION][MURDER]articles of furniture the eavesdropper distinguished the sound of askull striking the floor. He concluded that Professor Davenport hadknocked Miss Ida down with a blow of his fist, or had kicked her as sheapproached him. But the waiter did not enter the room, as no one rangfor him.II.
[W BOB HOLLAND][GHOST]That evening forty persons were assembled in Mrs. Joanne Harding’sparlor, staring at the curtain where a spirit form was in process ofmaterializing. One dark lantern in a corner of the room contributed thelight that emphasized the darkness rather than relieved it. The room waspervaded by profound silence, save the quickened, suppressed breathingof the spectators. The fire in the grate cast mysterious rays of light,resembling fugitive spirits, upon the objects around, almostindistinguishable in the semi-gloom.
[W BOB HOLLAND]Professor Davenport was at his best this evening. The spirit worldobeyed him without hesitation, like their lawful master. He was themighty prince of souls. Hands that had no arms were seen picking flowersfrom the vases; the touch of an invisible spirit conjured sweetmelodies from the keys of the piano; the furniture responded byintelligent rappings to the most unanticipated questions. The professor
[W BOB HOLLAND]himself elevated his form in symbolical distortions from the floor to analtitude of three feet, indicated by Mrs. Harding, and remainedsuspended in the air for a quarter of an hour, holding live coals in hishands.III.But the most interesting, as well as the most conclusive, test was to bethe materialization of the spirit of Mrs. Arabella Davenport, which theprofessor had promised at the beginning of the seance.[DIALOGUE]"The hour has come," exclaimed the medium.And while the hearts of all throbbed with anxious suspense, and theireyes distended with painful expectancy of the promised materialization,Benjamin Davenport stood before the curtain. In the twilight the tall
[W BOB HOLLAND][DANGER][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][EMOTION][PROBLEM][CHARACTER][HORROR]man with the disheveled hair and demon look, was really terrible andhandsome.[DIALOGUE]"Appear, Arabella!" he exclaimed, in a commanding voice, with gesturesof the Nazarene at the sepulcher of Lazarus.All are waiting----Suddenly a cry burst from behind the curtain--a piercing, shuddering,horrible shriek, the shriek of an expiring soul.The spectators trembled. Mrs. Harding almost fainted. The medium
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][CHARACTER][TRANSITION][METAPHOR]himself appeared surprised.But Benjamin recovered his composure on seeing the curtain move andadmit the spirit.The apparition was that of a young woman with long blonde tresses; shewas beautiful and pale, clad in some light, whitish material. Her breastwas bare, and on the left side appeared a bleeding wound, in whichtrembled a knife.
[W BOB HOLLAND][DANGER][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][EMOTION][MURDER]The spectators arose and retreated, pushing their chairs to the wall.Those who chanced to look at the medium noticed that a deathly pallorhad overspread his face, and that he was cowering and trembling.But the young woman, Mrs. Arabella, the real one, whom he so wellremembered, she had come in response to his summons, and advanced in adirect line toward Benjamin, who in terror covered his eyes to shut outthe ghastly sight, and with a cry fled behind the furniture. But shedipped the finger of her thin hand into the blood from her wound andtraced it across the brow of the unconscious medium, the whilerepeating, in a slow, monotonous tone that sounded like the echo of awail, again and again:[DIALOGUE]"You are my murderer! You are my murderer!"And while he was rolling and tossing in deadly terror on the floor theyturned up the lights.
[W BOB HOLLAND][DEATH][PROBLEM][CONTEXT][SURPRISE][HORROR]The spirit had vanished. But in the communicating room, behind thecurtain, they found the body of poor Miss Ida Soutchotte with horriblydistorted features. A physician who was present pronounced it heartstroke.And that is the reason that Prof. Benjamin Davenport appeared alone in a
[W BOB HOLLAND][PERSPECTIVE][CHARACTER][DANGER][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][MURDER]New York courtroom to answer to the charge of having murdered his wifefour years ago in San Francisco.THE PHANTOM WOMAN.He took an all-possessing, burning fancy to her from the first. She wasneither young nor pretty, so far as he could see--but she was wrappedround with mystery. That was the key of it all; she was noticeable in
[W BOB HOLLAND]spite of herself. Her face at the window, sunset after sunset; her eyes,gazing out mournfully through the dusty panes, hypnotized the lawyer. Hesaw her through the twilight night after night, and he grew at length towait through the days in a feverish waiting for dusk, and that one lookat an unknown woman.She was always at the same window on the ground floor, sitting doingnothing. She looked beyond, so the infatuated solicitor fancied, at him.
[W BOB HOLLAND][TRANSITION][CHARACTER][EMOTION][PERSPECTIVE][EXPOSITION][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][GHOST]Once he even thought that he detected the ghost of a friendly smile onher lips. Their eyes always met with a mute desire to make acquaintance.This romance went on for a couple of months.Gilbert Dent assured himself that nothing in this life can possiblyremain stationary, and he cudgeled his brain for a respectable manner ofintroducing himself to his idol.
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][EMOTION][TRANSITION][FLASHBACK][DANGER][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][HORROR]He had hardly arrived at this point when he received a shock. There camean evening when she was not at the window.Next morning he walked down Wood Lane on his way to the office. Healways went by train, but he felt a strong disinclination to go throughanother day without a sight of her. His heart began to beat like a
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE]schoolgirl’s as he drew near the house. If she should be at the window.He was almost disposed to take his courage in his hand and call on her,and--yes, even--tell her in a quick burst that she had mysteriouslybecome all the world to him. He could see nothing ridiculous in thiscourse; the possibility of her being married, or having family ties ofany sort, had simply never occurred to him.
[W BOB HOLLAND][HORROR]However, she was not at the window; what was more, there was a sinistersilence, a sort of breathlessness about the whole place.It was a very hot morning in late August. He looked a long time, but noface came, and no movement stirred the house.He went his way, walking like a man who has been heavily knocked on thebrow and sees stars still. That afternoon he left the office early, and
[W BOB HOLLAND][FLASHBACK][ACTION][TRANSITION][SURPRISE]in less than an hour stood at the gate again. The window was blank. Hepushed the gate back--it hung on one hinge--and walked up the drive tothe door. There were five steps--five steps leading up to it. At the
[W BOB HOLLAND][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE]foot he wheeled aside sharply to the window; he had a sick dread oflooking through the small panes--why he could not have told.When at last he found courage to look he saw that there was a smallround table set just under the window--a work-table to all appearance;one of those things with lots of little compartments all round and a lidin the middle which shut over a well-like cavity for holding pieces ofneedlework. He remembered that his mother had one--thirty years before.Round the edge of the table was gripped a small, delicate hand. Gilbert
[W BOB HOLLAND][DEATH]Dent’s eyes ran from this bloodless hand and slim wrist to a shoulderunder a coarse stuff bodice--to a rather wasted throat, which was bareand flung back.So this was the end--before the beginning. He saw her. She was dead;twisted on the floor with a ghastly face turned up toward the ceiling,and stiff fingers caught in desperation round the work table.
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][DEATH][PROBLEM][DANGER][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][FLASHBACK][CHARACTER][HORROR]He stumbled away along the path and into the lane.For a long time he could not realize the horror of this thing. Theinfluence of the decayed house hung over him--nothing seemed real. Itwas quite dark when he moved away from the gate, and went in thedirection of the nearest police station. That she was dead--this woman
[W BOB HOLLAND][DEATH][DANGER][PERSPECTIVE][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][MURDER]whose very name he did not know although she influenced him sopowerfully--he was certain; one look at the face would have told anyonethat. That she was murdered he more than suspected. He had seen no bloodabout; there had been no mark on the long, bare throat, and yet the wordrushed in his ears, [DIALOGUE]"Murder."Later on he went back with a police officer.They broke into the house and entered the room. It was in utter
[W BOB HOLLAND]darkness, of course, by now. Dent, his fingers trembling, struck amatch. It flared round the walls and lighted them for a moment before helet it fall on the dusty floor.The policeman began to light his lantern and turned it stolidly on thewindow. He had no reason for delay; he was eager to get to the bottom of
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][EMOTION][DANGER]the business. His professional zeal was whetted; this promised to be amystery with a spice in it.He turned the light full on the window; he gave a strange, choked cry,half of rage, half of apprehension. Then he went up to Gilbert Dent, whostood in the middle of the room with his hands before his eyes, and tookhis shoulder and shook it none too gently.
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][DIALOGUE]"There ain’t nobody," he said.Dent looked wildly at the window--the recess was empty except for thework-table. The woman was gone.They searched the house; they minutely inspected the garden. Everything
[W BOB HOLLAND][METAPHOR][CHARACTERIZATION][HAUNTED HOUSE]was normal; everything told the same mournful tale--of desertion, ofdeath, of long empty years. But they found no woman, nor trace of one.[DIALOGUE]"This house," said the policeman, looking suspiciously into the lawyer’sface, "has been empty for longer than I can remember. Nobody’ll live init. They do say something about foul play a good many years ago. I don’t
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][DANGER][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][EMOTION][ACTION][SUSPENSE][TRANSITION][WEAPON]know about that. All I do know is that the landlord can’t get it off hishands."It was doubtful if Gilbert Dent heard one word of what the man wassaying. He was too stunned to do anything but creep home--when he wasallowed to go--and let himself stealthily into his own house with alatch key; he was afraid even of himself. He did not go to bed that
[W BOB HOLLAND][TRANSITION][CHARACTERIZATION][PERSPECTIVE][DANGER][SETTING][METAPHOR][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][HORROR]night.As for the mystery of the woman, the matter was allowed to drop; itended--officially. There was a shrug and a grin at the police station.The impression there was that the lawyer had been drinking--that thedead woman in the empty room was a gruesome freak of his tipsy brain.
[W BOB HOLLAND][CHARACTERIZATION][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][PERSPECTIVE]       *       *       *       *       *A week or so later Dent called on his brother Ned--the one near relationhe had. Ned was a doctor; perhaps he was a shade more matter-of-factthan Gilbert; at all events, when the latter told his story of the houseand the woman, he attributed the affair solely to liver.[DIALOGUE]"You are overworked"--the elder brother looked at the younger’s yellowface. "An experience of this nature is by no means uncommon. Haven’t you
[W BOB HOLLAND]heard of people having their pet ‘spooks’?[DIALOGUE]""But this was a real woman,[DIALOGUE]" he declared. "I--I, well, I was in lovewith her. I had made up my mind to marry her--if I could.[DIALOGUE]"Ned gave him a keen, swift glance."We’ll go to Brighton to-morrow,[DIALOGUE]" he said, with quiet decision. "As foryour work, everything must be put aside. You’ve run completely down. You
[W BOB HOLLAND][CLIMAX][TRANSITION][FLASHBACK]ought to have been taken in hand before."They went to Brighton, and it really seemed as if Ned was right, andthat the woman at the window had been merely a nervous creation. Itseemed so, that is, for nearly three weeks, and then the climax came.It was in the twilight--she had always been part of it--that GilbertDent saw her again; the woman that he had found lying dead.
[W BOB HOLLAND][DANGER][EMOTION][ACTION][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][PROBLEM]They were walking, the two brothers, along the cliffs.The wind was blowing in their faces, the sea was booming beneath thecliff. Ned had just said it was about time they turned back to the hoteland had some dinner, when Gilbert with a cry leapt forward to the veryedge of the flat grass path on which they were strolling. The movementwas so sudden that his brother barely caught him in time. They
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][EMOTION][TRANSITION]struggled and swayed on the very edge of the cliff for a second;Gilbert, possessed by some sudden frenzy, seemed resolved to go over,but the other at last dragged him backward, and they rolled together onthe close, thick turf.At this point Gilbert opened his eyes and tried to get on his feet.[DIALOGUE]"Better?" asked his brother, cheerfully, holding out a helping hand."Strange! The sea has that effect on some people. Didn’t think that you
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][PERSPECTIVE][DANGER][HORROR]were one of them.[DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE]""What effect?""Vertigo, my dear fellow.""Ned,[DIALOGUE]" said the other solemnly, "I saw her. It is not worth your whileto try to account for anything. I have been inclined to think that youwere right--that she, the woman at the window, was a fancy, that I hadfallen in love with a creation of my own brain; but I saw her againto-night. You must have seen her yourself--she was within a couple of
[W BOB HOLLAND][DANGER][PROBLEM][DEATH][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][EXPOSITION][WEAPON][CHARACTERIZATION][ACTION][CONTEXT][MURDER]feet of you. Why did you not try and save her? It was nothing short ofmurder to let her go over like that. I did my best."
[W BOB HOLLAND][DANGER][CONFLICT][DEATH][MURDER][DIALOGUE]"You certainly did--to kill us both," said Ned, grimly.Gilbert gave him a wild look.After luncheon Ned persuaded him to rest--watched him fall asleep, andthen went out.In the porch of the hotel he was met by a waiter on his return who toldhim that Gilbert had left about a quarter of an hour after he hadhimself gone out.
[W BOB HOLLAND]Directly he heard this he feared the worst; having, as is usual in suchcases, a very hazy idea of what the worst might be. Of course he mustfollow without a moment’s delay; but a reference to the time-table toldhim that there was not another train for an hour, and that was slow.It was already getting dusk when he arrived there. He felt certain thatGilbert would go there. He got to the end of the lane and walked up it
[W BOB HOLLAND][PROBLEM]slowly, examining every house. There would be no difficulty inrecognizing the one he wanted; Gilbert had described it in detail morethan once.He stood outside the loosely hanging gate at last, and stared throughthe darkness at the shabby stucco front and rank garden.He went down a flight of steps to the back door, and finding itunfastened, stepped into a stone passage. It was one of the problems of
[W BOB HOLLAND][DANGER][EMOTION][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][PROBLEM]the place that he should have avoided the main entrance door with ahalf-admitted dread, and that, only half admitting still, he was afraidto mount the long flight of stone stairs leading from the servants’quarters. However, he pulled himself together and went up to the room.It was quite dark inside. He heard something scuttle across the floor;he felt the grit and dust of years under his feet. He struck a
[W BOB HOLLAND][FLASHBACK][MONSTER]match--just as Gilbert had done--and looked first at the recess in whichthe window was built. The match flared round the room for a moment andgave him a flash picture of his surroundings. He saw the stripes ofgaudy paper moving almost imperceptibly, like tentacles of some seamonster, from the wall; he saw a creature--it looked like a rat--scurryacross the floor from the window to the great mantelpiece of hard whitemarble.If he had seen nothing more than this.
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][HORROR]He saw in detail all that the first match had flashed at him. He saw hisbrother lying on the floor; a ghastly coincidence, his hand was caughtround the edge of the work-table as hers had been. The other hand wasclenched across his breast; there was a look of great agony on his face.A dead face, of course. This was the end of the affair. He was lying
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][FLASHBACK][DEATH][ACTION][EMOTION][METAPHOR][EXPOSITION][PERSPECTIVE][MURDER]dead by the window where the woman had sat every night at dusk andsmiled at him.The second match went out; the brother of the dead man struck a third.He looked again and closely. Then he staggered to his feet and gave acry. It rang through the empty rooms and echoed without wearying down
[W BOB HOLLAND][PERSPECTIVE][CONTEXT][CONFLICT][METAPHOR]the long, stone passages in the basement.Gilbert’s head was thrown back; his chin peaked to the ceiling. On histhroat were livid marks. The doctor saw them distinctly; he saw the gripof small fingers; the distinct impression of a woman’s little hand.
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][PROBLEM][DEATH][METAPHOR][TRANSITION][MURDER]       *       *       *       *       *The curious thing about the whole story--the most curious thing,perhaps--is that no other eye ever saw those murderous marks. So therewas no scandal, no chase after the murderer, no undiscovered crime. Theyfaded; when the doctor saw his brother again in the full light and inthe presence of others his throat was clear. And the post mortem provedthat death was due to natural causes.
[W BOB HOLLAND][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][CONTEXT][TRANSITION]So the matter stands, and will.But where the house and its overgrown garden stood runs a new road withneat red and white villas.Whatever secret it knew--if any--it kept discreetly.Ned Dent is morbid enough to go down the smart new road in the twilightsometimes and wonder.
[W BOB HOLLAND]THE PHANTOM HAG.The other evening in an old castle the conversation turned uponapparitions, each one of the party telling a story. As the accounts grewmore horrible the young ladies drew closer together.[DIALOGUE]"Have you ever had an adventure with a ghost?" said they to me. [DIALOGUE]"Do younot know a story to make us shiver? Come, tell us something."[DIALOGUE]"I am quite willing to do so," I replied. "I will tell you of an
[W BOB HOLLAND][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE][CHARACTER]incident that happened to myself."Toward the close of the autumn of 1858 I visited one of my friends,sub-prefect of a little city in the center of France. Albert was an oldcompanion of my youth, and I had been present at his wedding. Hischarming wife was full of goodness and grace. My friend wished to show
[W BOB HOLLAND]me his happy home, and to introduce me to his two pretty littledaughters. I was feted and taken great care of. Three days after myarrival I knew the entire city, curiosities, old castles, ruins, etc.Every day about four o’clock Albert would order the phaeton, and wewould take a long ride, returning home in the evening. One evening my
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][TRANSITION]friend said to me:"To-morrow we will go further than usual. I want to take you to theBlack Rocks. They are curious old Druidical stones, on a wild anddesolate plain. They will interest you. My wife has not seen them yet,
[W BOB HOLLAND][ACTION][TRANSITION][CONFLICT]so we will take her."The following day we drove out at the usual hour. Albert’s wife sat byhis side. I occupied the back seat alone. The weather was gray and
[W BOB HOLLAND][SETTING][DANGER][CONFLICT][EMOTION]somber that afternoon, and the journey was not very pleasant. When wearrived at the Black Rocks the sun was setting. We got out of thephaeton, and Albert took care of the horses.We walked some little distance through the fields before reaching thegiant remains of the old Druid religion. Albert’s wife wished to climb
[W BOB HOLLAND]to the summit of the altar, and I assisted her. I can still see hergraceful figure as she stood draped in a red shawl, her veil floatingaround her.[DIALOGUE]"How beautiful it is! But does it not make you feel a littlemelancholy?" said she, extending her hand toward the dark horizon, whichwas lighted a little by the last rays of the sun.The afternoon wind blew violently, and sighed through the stunted treesthat grew around the stone cromlechs; not a dwelling nor a human beingwas in sight. We hastened to get down, and silently retraced our stepsto the carriage.
[W BOB HOLLAND][DANGER][ACTION][DIALOGUE]"We must hurry," said Albert; [DIALOGUE]"the sky is threatening, and we shall havescarcely time to reach home before night."We carefully wrapped the robes around his wife. She tied the veil aroundher face, and the horses started into a rapid trot. It was growing dark;the scenery around us was bare and desolate; clumps of fir trees hereand there and furze bushes formed the only vegetation. We began to feelthe cold, for the wind blew with fury; the only sound we heard was thesteady trot of the horses and the sharp clear tinkle of their bells.
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][DANGER][PROBLEM][HORROR]Suddenly I felt the heavy grasp of a hand upon my shoulder. I turned myhead quickly. A horrible apparition presented itself before my eyes. Inthe empty place at my side sat a hideous woman. I tried to cry out; the
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][DANGER][METAPHOR][GHOST]phantom placed her fingers upon her lips to impose silence upon me. Icould not utter a sound. The woman was clothed in white linen; her headwas cowled; her face was overspread with a corpse-like pallor, and inplace of eyes were ghastly black cavities.I sat motionless, overcome by terror.
[W BOB HOLLAND]The ghost suddenly stood up and leaned over the young wife. Sheencircled her with her arms, and lowered her hideous head as if to kissher forehead.[DIALOGUE]"What a wind!" cried Madame Albert, turning precipitately toward me. [DIALOGUE]"Myveil is torn."As she turned I felt the same infernal pressure on my shoulder, and theplace occupied by the phantom was empty. I looked out to the right andleft--the road was deserted, not an object in sight.
[W BOB HOLLAND][DIALOGUE]"What a dreadful gale!" said Madame Albert. [DIALOGUE]"Did you feel it? I cannotexplain the terror that seized me; my veil was torn by the wind as if byan invisible hand; I am trembling still."[DIALOGUE]"Never mind," said Albert, smiling; [DIALOGUE]"wrap yourself up, my dear; we willsoon be warming ourselves by a good fire at home. I am starving."A cold perspiration covered my forehead; a shiver ran through me; mytongue clove to the roof of my mouth, and I could not articulate asound; a sharp pain in my shoulder was the only sensible evidence that Iwas not the victim of an hallucination. Putting my hand upon my achingshoulder, I felt a rent in the cloak that was wrapped around me. Ilooked at it; five perfectly distinct holes--visible traces of the gripof the horrible phantom. I thought for a moment that I should die or
[W BOB HOLLAND][TRANSITION]that my reason should leave me; it was, I think, the most dreadfulmoment of my life.Finally I became more calm; this nameless agony had lasted for someminutes; I do not think it is possible for a human being to suffer morethan I did during that time. As soon as I had recovered my senses, Ithought at first I would tell my friends all that had passed, buthesitated, and finally did not, fearing that my story would frightenMadame Albert, and feeling sure my friend would not believe me. Thelights of the little city revived me, and gradually the oppression ofterror that overwhelmed me became lighter.
[W BOB HOLLAND]So soon as we reached home, Madame Albert untied her veil; it wasliterally in shreds. I hoped to find my clothes whole and prove tomyself that it was all imagination. But no, the cloth was torn in fiveplaces, just where the fingers had seized my shoulder. There was nomark, however, upon my flesh, only a dull pain.
[W BOB HOLLAND][EMOTION][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK][METAPHOR][DANGER][HORROR]I returned to Paris the next day, where I endeavored to forget thestrange adventure; or at least when I thought of it, I would forcemyself to think it an hallucination.The day after my return I received a letter from my friend Albert. Itwas edged with black. I opened it with a vague fear.
[W BOB HOLLAND][DEATH][FLASHBACK][TRANSITION][SURPRISE]His wife had died the day of my return.FROM THE TOMB.TRANSLATED FROM THE FRENCH OF DE MAUPASSANT BY E. C. WAGGENER.
[W BOB HOLLAND]The guests filed slowly into the hotel’s great dining-hall and tooktheir places, the waiters began to serve them leisurely, to give thetardy ones time to arrive and to save themselves the bother of bringingback the courses; and the old bathers, the yearly habitues, with whomthe season was far advanced, kept a close watch on the door each time itopened, hoping for the coming of new faces.New faces! the single distraction of all pleasure resorts. We go todinner chiefly to canvass the daily arrivals, to wonder who they are,what they do and what they think. A restless desire seems to have taken
[W BOB HOLLAND]possession of us, a longing for pleasant adventures, for friendlyacquaintances, perhaps, for possible lovers. In this elbow-to-elbow lifeour unknown neighbors become of paramount importance. Curiosity ispiqued, sympathy on the alert and the social instinct doubly active.We have hatreds for a week, friendships for a month, and view all menwith the special eyes of watering-place intimacy. Sometimes during an
[W BOB HOLLAND]hour’s chat after dinner, under the trees of the park, where ripples ahealing spring, we discover men of superior intellect and surprisingmerit, and a month later have wholly forgotten these new friends, socharming at first sight.There, too, more specially than elsewhere, serious and lasting ties areformed. We see each other every day, we learn to know each other verysoon, and in the affection that springs up so rapidly between us thereis mingled much of the sweet abandon of old and tried intimates. Andlater on, how tender are the memories cherished of the first hours ofthis friendship, of the first communion in which the soul came to light,of the first glances that questioned and responded to the secretthoughts and interrogatories the lips have not dared yet to utter, ofthe first cordial confidence and delicious sensation of opening one’sheart to someone who has seemed to lay bare to you his own! The very
[W BOB HOLLAND][METAPHOR][PROBLEM][DANGER][SURPRISE][CHARACTERIZATION]dullness of the hours, as it were, the monotony of days all alike, butrenders more complete the rapid budding and blooming of friendship’sflower.That evening, then, as on every evening, we awaited the appearance ofunfamiliar faces.There came only two, but very peculiar ones, those of a man and awoman--father and daughter. They seemed to have stepped from the pagesof some weird legend; and yet there was an attraction about them, albeitan unpleasant one, that made me set them down at once as the victims ofsome fatality.
[W BOB HOLLAND]The father was tall, spare, a little bent, with hair blanched white; toowhite for his still young countenance, and in his manner and about hisperson the sedate austerity of carriage that bespeaks the Puritan. Thedaughter was, possibly, some twenty-four or twenty-five years of age.She was very slight, emaciated, her exceedingly pale countenance bearinga languid, spiritless expression; one of those people whom we sometimesencounter, apparently too weak for the cares and tasks of life, toofeeble to move or do the things that we must do every day. Neverthelessthe girl was pretty, with the ethereal beauty of an apparition. It was
[W BOB HOLLAND][PROBLEM][EMOTION][SURPRISE][CONFLICT]she, undoubtedly, who came for the benefit of the waters.They chanced to be placed at table immediately opposite to me; and I wasnot long in noticing that the father, too, had a strange affection,something wrong about the nerves it seemed. Whenever he was going toreach for anything, his hand, with a jerky twitch, described a sort offluttering zig-zag, before he was able to grasp what he was after. Soon,the motion disturbed me so much, I kept my head turned in order not tosee it. But not before I had also observed that the young girl kept her
[W BOB HOLLAND][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][METAPHOR]glove on her left hand while she ate.Dinner ended, I went out as usual for a turn in the grounds belonging tothe establishment. A sort of park, I might say, stretching clear to thelittle station of Auvergne, Chatel-Guyon, nestling in a gorge at thefoot of the high mountain, from which flowed the sparkling, bubblingsprings, hot from the furnace of an ancient volcano. Beyond us there,the domes, small extinct craters--of which Chatel-Guyon is the startingpoint--raised their serrated heads above the long chain; while beyondthe domes came two distinct regions, one of them, needle-like peaks, theother of bold, precipitous mountains.
[W BOB HOLLAND][FLASHBACK][PERSPECTIVE]It was very warm that evening, and I contented myself with pacing to andfro under the rustling trees, gazing at the mountains and listening tothe strains of the band, pouring from the Casino, situated on a knollthat overlooked the grounds.Presently, I perceived the father and daughter coming toward me withslow steps. I bowed to them in that pleasant Continental fashion withwhich one always salutes his hotel companions. The gentleman halted atonce.
[W BOB HOLLAND][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][DIALOGUE]"Pardon me, sir," said he, [DIALOGUE]"but may I ask if you can direct us to ashort walk, easy and pretty, if possible?"[DIALOGUE]"Certainly," I answered, and offered to lead them myself to the valleythrough which the swift river flows--a deep, narrow cleft between twogreat declivities, rocky and wooded.They accepted, and as we walked, we naturally discussed the virtue ofthe mineral waters. They had, as I had surmised, come there on hisdaughter’s account.[DIALOGUE]"She has a strange malady," said he, "the seat of which her physicianscannot determine. She suffers from the most inexplicable nervoussymptoms. Sometimes they declare her ill of a heart disease; sometimesof a liver complaint; again of a spinal trouble. At present they
[W BOB HOLLAND][METAPHOR][PROBLEM]attribute it to the stomach--that great motor and regulator of thebody--this Protean disease of a thousand forms, a thousand modes ofattack. It is why we are here. I, myself, think it is her nerves. In anycase it is sad."
[W BOB HOLLAND]This reminded me of his own jerking hand.[DIALOGUE]"It may be hereditary," said I, [DIALOGUE]"your own nerves are a little disturbed,are they not?"[DIALOGUE]"Mine?" he answered, tranquilly. [DIALOGUE]"Not at all, I have always possessedthe calmest nerves." Then, suddenly, as if bethinking himself:[DIALOGUE]"For this," touching his hand, [DIALOGUE]"is not nerves, but the result of ashock, a terrible shock that I suffered once. Fancy it, sir, this childof mine has been buried alive!"I could find nothing to say, I was dumb with surprise.[DIALOGUE]"Yes," he continued, "buried alive; but hear the story, it is not long.For some time past Juliette had seemed affected with a disordered actionof the heart. We were finally certain that the trouble was organic andfeared the worst. One day it came, she was brought in lifeless--dead.
[W BOB HOLLAND][DEATH][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][ACTION]She had fallen dead while walking in the garden. Physicians came inhaste, but nothing could be done. She was gone. For two days and nightsI watched beside her myself, and with my own hands placed her in hercoffin, which I followed to the cemetery and saw placed in the familyvault. This was in the country, in the province of Lorraine.
[W BOB HOLLAND][EMOTION][FLASHBACK][HORROR]"It had been my wish, too, that she should be buried in her jewels,bracelets, necklace and rings, all presents that I had given her, and inher first ball dress. You can imagine, sir, the state of my heart inreturning home. She was all that I had left, my wife had been dead formany years. I returned, in truth, half mad, shut myself alone in my roomand fell into my chair dazed, unable to move, merely a miserable,breathing wreck.
[W BOB HOLLAND][DANGER][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][CHARACTER][TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][DIALOGUE]"Soon my old valet, Prosper, who had helped me place Juliette in hercoffin and lay her away for her last sleep, came in noiselessly to seeif he could not induce me to eat. I shook my head, answering nothing. Hepersisted:"‘Monsieur is wrong; this will make him ill. Will monsieur allow me,then, to put him to bed?’
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][EMOTION][PROBLEM][FLASHBACK][HORROR][DIALOGUE]"‘No, no,’ I answered. ‘Let me alone.’"He yielded and withdrew."How many hours passed I do not know. What a night! What a night! It was
[W BOB HOLLAND][DANGER][EMOTION][DEATH][HORROR]very cold; my fire of logs had long since burned out in the greatfireplace; and the wind, a wintry blast, charged with an icy frost,howled and screamed about the house and strained at my windows with acuriously sinister sound."Long hours, I say, rolled by. I sat still where I had fallen,prostrated, overwhelmed; my eyes wide open, but my body strengthless,dead; my soul drowned in despair. Suddenly the great bell gave a loudpeal.
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][DIALOGUE]"I gave such a leap that my chair cracked under me. The slow, solemnsound rang through the empty house. I looked at the clock."It was two in the morning. Who could be coming at such an hour?"Twice again the bell pulled sharply. The servants would never answer,perhaps never hear it. I took up a candle and made my way to the door. I
[W BOB HOLLAND]was about to demand:[DIALOGUE]"‘Who is there?’ but, ashamed of the weakness, nerved myself and drewback the bolts. My heart throbbed, my pulse beat, I threw back the panelbrusquely and there, in the darkness, saw a shape like a phantom,dressed in white."I recoiled, speechless with anguish, stammering:[DIALOGUE]"‘Who--who are you?’"A voice answered:[DIALOGUE]"‘It is I, father.’"It was my child, Juliette."Truly, I thought myself mad. I shuddered, shrinking backward before thespecter as it advanced, gesticulating with my hand to ward off theapparition. It is that gesture which has never left me.
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][FLASHBACK][RELIEF][TRANSITION][PROBLEM][GHOST][DIALOGUE]"Again the phantom spoke:"‘Father, father! See, I am not dead. Someone came to rob me of myjewels--they cut off my finger--the--the flowing blood revived me.’"And I saw then that she was covered with blood. I fell to my knees
[W BOB HOLLAND][DEATH][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][MURDER]panting, sobbing, laughing, all in one. As soon as I regained my senses,but still so bewildered I scarcely comprehended the happiness that hadcome to me, I took her in my arms, carried her to her room, and rangfrantically for Prosper to rekindle the fire, bring a warm drink forher, and go for the doctor.[DIALOGUE]"He came running, entered, gazed a moment at my daughter in thechair--gave a gasp of fright and horror and fell back--dead."It was he who had opened the vault, who had wounded and robbed mychild, and then abandoned her; for he could not efface all trace of hisdeed; and he had not even taken the trouble to return the coffin to itsniche; sure, besides, of not being suspected by me, who trusted him sofully. We are truly very unfortunate people, monsieur."He was silent.
[W BOB HOLLAND][EMOTION]Meanwhile the night had come on, enveloping in the gloom the still andsolitary little valley; a sort of mysterious dread seemed to fall uponme in presence of these strange beings--this corpse come to life, andthis father with his painful gestures.[DIALOGUE]"Let us return," said I, [DIALOGUE]"the night has grown chill."And still in silence, we retraced our steps back to the hotel, and Ishortly afterward returned to the city. I lost all further knowledge ofthe two peculiar visitors to my favorite summer resort.SANDY’S GHOST."‘Commerdations fer the night, stranger? Waal, yes; I reckon we can fix
[W BOB HOLLAND][EMOTION][SURPRISE][SETTING][PERSPECTIVE][TRANSITION][CHARACTERIZATION][PROBLEM][METAPHOR][CONTEXT]a place fer you. Hev a cheer an’ set you down.[DIALOGUE]""Thank you. Don’t you find this rather a lonely place--no neighbors, nonothing, that I can see? How came you to settle here, so far removed
[W BOB HOLLAND][CHARACTER]from other habitations?[DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE]""Waal, perhaps it’s best not ter ask too many questions ter once.""Beg your pardon. No offense was intended, I assure you. Simply idlecuriosity.""Don’t say ’nuther word, stranger, but come in an’ we’ll hev a snack fersupper. Polly, bring on the victu’ls. Yer jes’ in time."Polly at once obeyed. She was a typical Western girl--tall, lithe,graceful and limpid-eyed. She was clear-skinned and high-spirited, too,and in this case ignorant through no fault of her own. John Barr’s eyes
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][EMOTION][FLASHBACK]scanned her intently, and a flush came to her cheeks. For the first timein her life she was unpleasantly conscious of her bare feet. It may havebeen this that made her stumble and spill some of the contents of anearthen bowl over the guest’s knees as she placed it on the table.Her eyes flashed and a tear of anger twinkled on the lashes. She
[W BOB HOLLAND][CHARACTER][CONFLICT][FLASHBACK]stopped, half meaning to apologize, but an oath from her father causedher to set the bowl down heavily and to hurry from the cabin. A momentlater Barr saw a flutter of pink calico from behind a pile of rocks. OldKit Robinson saw it, too."Don’t wonder at yer sayin’ ’tain’t right. She’s a sma’t gal, and a good
[W BOB HOLLAND][DANGER][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][METAPHOR]looker, too, as should hev been sent away frum here ter school ter beeddicated. But she won’t leave her no ’count dad. I orter be shot fercussin’ her. But I ain’t what I use ter be. Settin’ here an’ keepin’
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK][PERSPECTIVE][EMOTION]guard makes me narvous."Barr’s eyes asked the question his lips refused to speak. Supper eaten,the men went outside and sat with their chairs tilted back against thecabin. Something in the younger man’s frank face had softened old Kitinto a reminiscent mood and made him strangely inclined to gratify anidle curiosity.
[W BOB HOLLAND][CHARACTER][PERSPECTIVE]The soft evening winds sighed through the branches of the tall sprucepines, and the declining rays of the setting sun caused the shadow ofthe rude home to stretch out longer across the greensward. From itsshelter where he sat John Barr looked out on the grand ranges of theRockies and wondered where in their vastness he would find the man hesought--the finding of whom had brought him out into this wild andalmost forsaken mining camp."Stranger, I’ve took a likin’ ter you. Ye’ve a sumthin’ about you thetreminds me of sum one I know, an’ you look like an honest chap. Say, do
[W BOB HOLLAND][EMOTION]you b’lieve in ghosts?[DIALOGUE]"He put the question very suddenly, and a look of disappointment crossedhis face when Barr told him that he did not believe in spooks."Waal, I’ve seen ’em![DIALOGUE]"A thought connecting the pink calico with something in the past came toBarr’s mind."Can’t you tell me about it?[DIALOGUE]" he asked."I’d like ter if you’ll sw’ar, on yer derringer, never ter blab. Willyou sw’ar?"The solitary guest started to smile, but the smile faded at the thoughtof unshed tears in Polly’s eyes. It might make it easier for her if hehumored the old man.
[W BOB HOLLAND][ACTION][SURPRISE][DANGER][WEAPON][PERSPECTIVE][DIALOGUE]"I’ll swear," he said. And he did."Do you see yan old spruce at the turn of the trail an’ the cliff jes’above? Waal, thet’s the spot I’m watchin’ an’ guardin’ till the ownercums ter claim it. I’m quick ter burn powder an’ a pretty sure shot. I
[W BOB HOLLAND][CHARACTER][PERSPECTIVE][EMOTION]know a man when I sees him, an’ I ain’t easy fooled. Waal, ter beginwith, I had a pardner once, an’ he wuz a man, sure ’nough. He wuz frumthe State of New York. I never axed him as ter how so fine a gent cumter be diggin’ an’ shov’lin’ in the Rockies, though ter myself I saidthar wuz sum good reason. He had light hair, an’ we called him Sandy,
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT]fer short, an’ he wuz jes’ erbout as gritty as sand. We wuz as unlike asany two fellers you ever saw. He wuz quietlike an’ steady, an’ I wuzsorter wild an’ reckless an’ liked mounting dew mos’ too well. Waal,when we had a little dust scraped together, we would divvy, an’ I tuk myshare way down ter the station on the other side of the cliffs an’ sentit off ter the bank in Helena. But I allers left sum hid whar the gal
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][SURPRISE]would find it. Old Sandy hed a bank of his own thet no one knew erbout,’cepting hisself, an’ ev’ry time we divided he’d carry part of it terhis hidin’ place, an’ then give the rest ter me ter send ter his boy,thet he said wuz bein’ eddicated in sum college way up in Boston. Heseemed ter think a heap of thet boy. Arter awhile my old woman give out,an’ soon we laid her away on the hillside. It wuz hard, stranger."
[W BOB HOLLAND][DEATH]Old Kit’s voice failed him for a moment, but he quickly regained hiscomposure and continued:"But when old Sandy, my good old pard, give up I didn’t keer fernothin’. We buried him in style. All the boys frum round the diggin’swuz thar, an’ many an eye wuz wet. We didn’t hev nary a preacher, butthe gal she prayed at the grave. Fer the life of me I don’t know where

Reckon the old woman must hev told her. Next mornin’ thegal showed me a letter thet Sandy give her jes’ afore he died. It wuzter his boy, an’ she wuz ter give it ter him if he ever cum out thisway, an’ she’s got it yet.
[W BOB HOLLAND][EMOTION]"Thet same evenin’ after supper, feelin’ kinder glumish an’ like tharwuz sumthin’ in my throat I couldn’t swaller, I tuk a stroll up thegulch. I went on out ter the top of the edge of the big rock an’ got terstudyin’ whar I’d find another pard like Sandy. All ter once I felt ahand touch my shoulder kinder light once or twice. I jumped up, halfexpectin’ it wuz Sandy, but it wuz only the gal. Waal, I wuz all tuk
[W BOB HOLLAND][EMOTION][CONFLICT][FLASHBACK]back at fust, an’ then I got mad.[DIALOGUE]"‘What air you doin’ up here?’ I axed, kinder rough. She hed tears inher eyes as she looked at me, an’ said:"‘Pap, don’t git mad. I wuz lonesum. I seed you cumin’ up this way, an’

I tried ter think whar could he hev hid it. But it warn’t no use.All ter once I noticed it wuz plum dark, an’ as these mountings ain’t ahe’lthy place fer a man ter roam in arter nightfall, especially if heain’t got his shootin’ irons on, I cut a pretty swift gait fer theshack.
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][DANGER][PERSPECTIVE]"Jes’ as I cum round the bend thar at the pine I happened ter look upterward the clift, an’ thar sot Sandy. Yes, sir. It wuz him sure as yerborn. My feet felt heavy as lead, an’ I couldn’t move frum the spot. I
[W BOB HOLLAND][DANGER][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][ACTION][TRANSITION]tried ter holler, but it warn’t no go. Finally I gave a sudden jerk an’made a step terward him, an’ as I did so he disappeared. Then I madetracks fer home. But I kept mum, ’cause I knowed the boys would say thetmounting dew wuz lickin’ up my brains, an’ I would be seein’ snakes an’sich things afore long.
[W BOB HOLLAND][DIALOGUE]"The next night sumhow er ’nuther I thought ter go an’ see if he wuzthar ag’in, an’ sure ’nough, thar he sot, lookin’ kinder sad an’ makingmarks on the rocks with his fingers. I hed my hand on my gun this time,so I got a little closter than afore. But, by hookey, he got away fromme ag’in, nor did he cum back."I could hardly wait fer the next night ter cum round. At the same timeI wuz on hand good an’ early, jes’ as it begun ter git dark, an’ thetrees looked like long spooks a-stretchin’ out their arms. I lookedterward the clift, an’ thar he sot a-markin’ an’ a-scratchin’ on therock with his fingers an’ still looking sad. Now, this bein’ the thirdtime, I kinder got bold, an’ I went a little closter, an’ says:"‘Sandy, wha-what’s the ma-mat-matter with you? Didn’t the boys do theplantin’ right fer you?’
[W BOB HOLLAND][DIALOGUE]"Then as luck would hev it I thought of sumthin’ else right quick, an’ Isaid:"‘Or is it the dust you hev hid whar yer sittin’?’[DIALOGUE]"Waal, he looked up then, an’ the happiest smile cum ter his face, an’all ter once he disappeared ag’in. An’ since then I hev sot here an’guarded the place till the right one cums along ter claim it."Let’s see. What did you say yer name wuz?[DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE]""Pardon me. I thought I had told you. My name is John Willett Barr.""Polly, oh, Polly! Cum hyar, gal. What wuz Sandy’s full name? I plum
[W BOB HOLLAND]fergot.[DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE]""What you want ter know fer?[DIALOGUE]" she asked. "I ain’t a-goin’ ter tell younow. Thet’s my own secret.""Cum, cum, gal. Tell me ter once, or it won’t be he’lthy fer you.""Waal, then,[DIALOGUE]" she answered stubbornly, "it’s John Willett Barr.[DIALOGUE]"At her reply the younger man’s face grew deathly pale, and he started upfrom his chair, but Kit thrust him back into his seat, saying:"Bring me the letter, Polly.""What are you goin’ ter do with it, pa?[DIALOGUE]" she inquired, cautiously."I promised old Sandy on my oath ter keep it till the right one cumserlong ter claim it, an’ I mean ter keep my word. The right one is here,
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][EXPOSITION][DANGER][PERSPECTIVE]gal. Thar he sits. So trot thet letter out, an’ don’t parley long withme if you knows when yer well off."Polly stared at the younger man in utter bewilderment for a moment.
[W BOB HOLLAND]Then, turning slowly, she stepped quietly into the cabin after theprecious document; an unusual gleam of joy lighted up her face and asuppressed excitement shone in her eyes. Under her breath she said:[DIALOGUE]"Sumhow er ruther I felt he wuz the right one."Too truly, John Barr realized in that painful moment that he whom hesought was now dead to him; that the father from whom he had been partedso many years was sleeping that long, dreamless sleep in the clay moundon the hillside, which marked his last resting place. As he turned tolook at the face of old, honest Kit, who had been his father’s friendduring those long years of forced exile, a happy smile lit up the oldminer’s rugged features as he pointed with his finger to the rock cliffnear the old spruce vine, and said, in an exultant, trembling voice:[DIALOGUE]"Thar he be, stranger--jes’ as I hev seen him many a night--yer dad--mypard--pore old Sandy!"With an eager voice John Barr sprang forward, and the mountains echoedand re-echoed the plaintive cry of [DIALOGUE]"Father! Father!" But hisoutstretched arms clasped only emptiness and the darkening shadows ofthe rapidly approaching night.THE GHOSTS OF RED CREEK.
[W BOB HOLLAND]BY S. T.To the northward of Mississippi City and its neighbor, Handsboro, thereextends a tract of pine forest for miles with but few habitationsscattered through it. Black and Red Creeks, with their numerousbranches, drain this region into the Pascagoula River to the eastward.
[W BOB HOLLAND][CHARACTER][EMOTION][PERSPECTIVE]With the swamps of Pascagoula as a refuge, and the luxuriant andunfrequented bottoms of Red and Black Creeks to browse upon, there arefew choicer spots for deer. Knowing this fact, a small party ofgentlemen on the day before a crisp, cold Christmas, started fromHandsboro in a large four-wheeled wagon for a thirty-mile drive intothis wilderness of pine and a week’s sport after the deer. The guide wasJim Caruthers, a true woodsman, and the driver and general factotum, ajolly negro named Jack Lyons, than whom no one could make a betterhoe-cake and cook a venison steak. His laugh could be heard a quarter ofa mile, and his good nature was as expansive as the range of thelaughter.
[W BOB HOLLAND]The usual experiences of a hunting camp were heartily enjoyed duringthe first days of this life out of doors; but its cream did not riseuntil about the fifth night, when, from familiar intercourse, Jack Lyonsbecame loquacious, and after the day’s twenty or twenty-five-mile walk,would spin yarns in front of the camp fire, which brought forgetfulnessof fatigue.The night before New Year’s was intensely cold. The cold north wind ofthe afternoon had subsided at sunset, and only a gust now and againtouched the musical leaves of the pines, making them vibrant with thatmournful score of nature’s operas which even maestros have failed tocatch.In front of two new and white tents two sportsmen reclined at lengthwithin reach of the warmth of the fire, while opposite them rested atease the guide and the worthy Jack Lyons.
[W BOB HOLLAND]Wearied with the day’s chase four stanch hounds--Ringwood, Rose, Jet andBoxer--were dreaming of future quarry.The firelight brought out in bright relief the trunks of the tall pineslike cathedral columns, and sparkling through the leafy dome overheadthe scintillating stars glistened with a diamond brightness. A silencewhich added its influence to the scene rested about the borders of thecreek below, and gave more effect to the story of the veteran teamsterthan perhaps it otherwise would have had.[DIALOGUE]"If de deer run down de creek," said old Jack, smacking his lips over acarefully prepared brewing of the real Campbellton punch, [DIALOGUE]"wese boun’ tosee fun to-morrer, for dey’ll take us down thar by de old Gibbet’splace. In daylight dere’s no place like it, but after nightfall, you betyou wouldn’t catch dis nigger thar."Old Jack was naturally asked why he didn’t care about visiting theGibbet’s place at night. Asking to be excused until he filled his pipe,the silence was unbroken until his return. He piled on more pine knots
[W BOB HOLLAND]and commenced:[DIALOGUE]"You kno’, gemmen, dat when de gunboats was in de sound we folks had totravel way back hyar on dese roads outun de range of deir big guns. Iwas ’gaged by Mr. Harrison in hauling salt from de factory atMississippi City, on de beach ober to Mobile, an’ I had been making atrip ebery week or so. Dis back country road was neber thought ob by deFederals, an’ we had good times long de way, no shells and no shootin’."De nite, gemmen, I’se speakin’ of was a Friday, dat yous all knows isunlucky.

Marie are as white and luminous asthe Milky Way. The silence that rests upon the solitude appears to be
[W BOB HOLLAND][METAPHOR][SURPRISE]white also. Nature has included sound in her arrestment. Save the stillwhite frost, all things are obliterated. The stars are there, but theyseem to belong to heaven and not to earth. They are at an immeasurable
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][PERSPECTIVE][HORROR]height, and so black is the night that the opaque ether rolls betweenthem and the observer in great liquid billows.In such a place it is difficult to believe that the world is peopled toany great extent. One fancies that Cain has just killed Abel, and thatthere is need for the greatest economy in the matter of human life.The night Ralph Hagadorn started out for Echo Bay he felt as if he werethe only man in the world, so complete was the solitude through which hewas passing. He was going over to attend the wedding of his best friend,
[W BOB HOLLAND][TRANSITION][CHARACTER][METAPHOR][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][EMOTION][CLIMAX][CHARACTERIZATION][CONTEXT][DANGER][PROBLEM]and was, in fact, to act as the groomsman. Business had delayed him, andhe was compelled to make his journey at night. But he hadn’t gone farbefore he began to feel the exhilaration of the skater. His skates werekeen, his legs fit for a longer journey than the one he had undertaken,and the tang of the frost was to him what a spur is to a spirited horse.
[W BOB HOLLAND][PERSPECTIVE][TRANSITION][WEAPON][CHARACTER][CONFLICT][DANGER][METAPHOR][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK]He cut through the air as a sharp stone cleaves the water. He could feelthe tumult of the air as he cleft it. As he went on he began to havefancies. It seemed to him that he was enormously tall--a great Viking ofthe Northland, hastening over icy fiords to his love. That reminded him
[W BOB HOLLAND]that he had a love--though, indeed, that thought was always present withhim as a background for other thoughts. To be sure, he had not told hershe was his love, because he had only seen her a few times and theopportunity had not presented itself. She lived at Echo Bay, too, andwas to be the maid of honor to his friend’s bride--which was anotherreason why he skated on almost as swiftly as the wind, and why, now andthen, he let out a shout of exhilaration.The one drawback in the matter was that Marie Beaujeu’s father hadmoney, and that Marie lived in a fine house and wore otter skin abouther throat and little satin-lined mink boots on her feet when she wentsledding, and that the jacket in which she kept a bit of her deadmother’s hair had a black pearl in it as big as a pea. These things
[W BOB HOLLAND]made it difficult--nay, impossible--for Ralph Hagadorn to say anythingmore than [DIALOGUE]"I love you." But that much he meant to have the satisfactionof saying, no matter what came of it.With this determination growing upon him he swept along the ice whichgleamed under the starlight. Indeed, Venus made a glowing path towardthe west and seemed to reassure him. He was sorry he could not skim downthat avenue of light from the love star, but he was forced to turn hisback upon it and face toward the northeast.
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE]It came to him with a shock that he was not alone. His eyelashes were agood deal frosted and his eyeballs blurred with the cold, and at firsthe thought it an illusion. But he rubbed his eyes hard and at lengthmade sure that not very far in front of him was a long white skater influttering garments who sped over the snows fast as ever werewolf went.He called aloud, but there was no answer, and then he gave chase,setting his teeth hard and putting a tension on his firm young muscles.
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][DANGER][PROBLEM][TRANSITION]But however fast he might go the white skater went faster. After a timehe became convinced, as he chanced to glance for a second at the NorthStar, that the white skater was leading him out of his direct path. Fora moment he hesitated, wondering if he should not keep to his road, butthe strange companion seemed to draw him on irresistibly, and so hefollowed.Of course it came to him more than once that this might be no earthlyguide. Up in those latitudes men see strange things when the hoar frost
[W BOB HOLLAND]is on the earth. Hagadorn’s father, who lived up there with the LakeSuperior Indians and worked in the copper mines, had once welcomed awoman at his hut on a bitter night who was gone by morning, and who leftwolf tracks in the snow--yes, it was so, and John Fontanelle, thehalf-breed, could tell you about it any day--if he were alive. (Alack,the snow where the wolf tracks were is melted now!)Well, Hagadorn followed the white skater all the night, and when the iceflushed red at dawn and arrows of lovely light shot up into the coldheavens, she was gone, and Hagadorn was at his destination. Then, as he
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE]took off his skates while the sun climbed arrogantly up to his placeabove all other things, Hagadorn chanced to glance lakeward, and he sawthere was a great wind-rift in the ice and that the waves showed blue assapphires beside the gleaming ice. Had he swept along his intended path,watching the stars to guide him, his glance turned upward, all his bodyat magnificent momentum, he must certainly have gone into that coldgrave. The white skater had been his guardian angel!Much impressed, he went up to his friend’s house, expecting to findthere the pleasant wedding furore. But someone met him quietly at the
[W BOB HOLLAND][DEATH][DANGER][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][EMOTION][TRANSITION]door, and his friend came downstairs to greet him with a solemndemeanor.[DIALOGUE]"Is this your wedding face?" cried Hagadorn. [DIALOGUE]"Why, really, if this isthe way you are affected, the sooner I take warning the better."[DIALOGUE]"There’s no wedding to-day," said his friend.[DIALOGUE]"No wedding? Why, you’re not----"[DIALOGUE]"Marie Beaujeu died last night----"[DIALOGUE]"Marie----""Died last night. She had been skating in the afternoon, and she came
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE]home chilled and wandering in her mind, as if the frost had got in itsomehow. She got worse and worse and talked all the time of you.[DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE]""Of me?""We wondered what it all meant. We didn’t know you were lovers.""I didn’t know it myself; more’s the pity.""She said you were on the ice. She said you didn’t know about the bigbreaking up, and she cried to us that the wind was off shore. Then she
[W BOB HOLLAND]cried that you could come in by the old French Creek if you onlyknew----?[DIALOGUE]""I came in that way,[DIALOGUE]" interrupted Hagadorn."How did you come to do that? It’s out of your way."So Hagadorn told him how it came to pass.And that day they watched beside the maiden, who had tapers at her headand feet, and over in the little church the bride who might have been ather wedding said prayers for her friend. Then they buried her in herbridesmaid’s white, and Hagadorn was there before the altar with her, ashe intended from the first. At midnight the day of the burial her
[W BOB HOLLAND][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][CONFLICT]friends were married in the gloom of the cold church, and they walkedtogether through the snow to lay their bridal wreaths on her grave.Three nights later Hagadorn started back again to his home. They wantedhim to go by sunlight, but he had his way and went when Venus made herbright path on the ice. He hoped for the companionship of the whiteskater. But he did not have it. His only companion was the wind. The
[W BOB HOLLAND][GHOST]only voice he heard was the baying of a wolf on the north shore. Theworld was as white as if it had just been created and the sun had notyet colored nor man defiled it.HOW HE CAUGHT THE GHOST.[DIALOGUE]"Yes, the house is a good one," said the agent; "it’s in a goodneighborhood, and you’re getting it at almost nothing; but I think itright to tell you all about it. You are orphans, you say, and with amother dependent on you? That makes it all the more necessary that you
[W BOB HOLLAND]should know. The fact is, the house is said to be haunted----[DIALOGUE]"The agent could not help smiling as he said it, and he was relieved tosee an answering smile on the two faces before him."Ah, you don’t believe in ghosts,[DIALOGUE]" he went on; "nor do I, for thatmatter; but, somehow, the reputation of the house keeps me from having atenant long at a time. The place ought to rent for twice as much as itdoes.[DIALOGUE]""If we succeed in driving out the ghost, you will not raise the rent?[DIALOGUE]"asked the boy, with a merry twinkle in his eyes."Well, no--not this year, at any rate," laughed the agent. And so thehouse was rented; and the slip of a girl and the tall lad, her brother,went their way.Within a week the family had moved into the house, and were delightedwith it. It was large and cool, with wide halls and fine stairways, and
[W BOB HOLLAND][HAUNTED HOUSE]with more room than they needed. But that did not matter in the least,for they had always been cramped in small houses, suffering manydiscomforts; and they never could have afforded such a place as this ifit had not been [DIALOGUE]"haunted."[DIALOGUE]"Blessings on the ghost!" cried Margaret, gaily, as she ran about asmerry as a child. [DIALOGUE]"Who would be without a ghost in the house, when itbrings one like this?"[DIALOGUE]"And it is so near your school," said the mother; [DIALOGUE]"and I used to worryso over the long walk; and David can come home to lunch now, and youdon’t know what a pleasure that will be."[DIALOGUE]"It seems to me," David gravely explained, "that if I should meet theghost I would treat him with the greatest politeness and encourage himto stay. We shall not miss the room he takes, shall we? I think it would
[W BOB HOLLAND]be well to set aside that room over yours, Maggie, for his ghostship’sown, for we shall not need that, you know. Besides, the door doesn’tshut, and he can go in and out without breaking the lock."And then they all laughed and had a great deal of fun over the ghost,which was a great joke to them.They were very tired that night and slept soundly all night long. When
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][ACTION][GHOST]they met the next morning there was more laughter about the ghost whichwas shy about meeting strangers, probably, and had made no effort tointroduce himself. For the next three days they were all hard at work,trying to bring chaos into something like order; and then it was timefor the school to open, and Margaret was to begin teaching, and Davidinserted an advertisement in the city papers for a maid-of-all-work, whomight help their mother in their absence.For one whole day prospective colored servants presented themselves andannounced:[DIALOGUE]"Is dis de house whar dey wants a worklady? No, ma’am, I ain’ gwine towork in dis house. Ketch me workin’ in no ha’nted house."After which they each and all departed, and others came in their stead.One was secured after a while, but no sooner had she talked across thefence with a neighbor’s servant than she, too, departed.
[W BOB HOLLAND][DIALOGUE]"Never mind, children," said Mrs. Craig, wearily, [DIALOGUE]"I would much ratherdo the work than be troubled in this way."So the maid-of-all-work was dismissed and the Craig family locked thedoors and went to their rooms, worn out with the day’s anxieties.They had been in the house four days, and there had been neither sightnor sound of the ghost. The very mention of it was enough to start themall to laughing, for they were thoroughly practical people, with afondness for inquiring into anything that seemed mysterious to them andfor understanding it thoroughly before they let it go.David was soon sleeping the sound sleep of healthy boyhood, and all wassilent in the house, when Margaret stole softly into his room and laidher hand on his arm. He was not easy to waken, and several minutes had
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE]passed before he sat up in bed with an articulate murmur of surprise.[DIALOGUE]"Hush!" said Margaret, in a whisper, with her hand on his lips. [DIALOGUE]"I wantyou to come into my room and listen to a sound that I have been hearingfor some time."[DIALOGUE]"Doors creaking," suggested David, as he began to dress.[DIALOGUE]"Nothing of the kind," was all she said.They walked up the stairway, and along the upper hall to the door of theunused room. Something was wrong with the lock and the door would notstay fastened, as I have said.
[W BOB HOLLAND][GHOST]Something that was not fear thrilled their hearts as they pushed thedoor further ajar, and stood where they could see every foot of thevacant floor. One of their own boxes stood in the middle of the room,but aside from that, nothing was to be seen, and they looked at oneanother in silence.[DIALOGUE]"Hold the lamp a minute, Maggie," David said, at last, and then he wentall over the room, and looked more particularly at its emptiness, andeven felt the walls.[DIALOGUE]"Secret panels, you know," he said, with a smile, but it was a verypuzzled smile indeed.[DIALOGUE]"I can’t see what it could have been," Margaret said, as they went downthe stairs.[DIALOGUE]"No, I can’t see, either, but I’m going to see," said David. [DIALOGUE]"That was achain, and chains don’t drag around by themselves, you know. A ghostcould not drag a chain, if he were to try."[DIALOGUE]"The conventional ghost very often drags chains," said Margaret, as sheclosed the door of her room.And then she lay awake all night and listened for the conventional ghostthat dragged a chain, but it seemed that the weight of the chain musthave wearied him, for he was not heard again.
[W BOB HOLLAND][EMOTION][GHOST]The mother had slept through it all, and next morning they gave her avivid account of the night’s adventure.[DIALOGUE]"Perhaps it was someone in the house," she said, in alarm. There were noghosts within the bounds of possibility, so far as she was concerned,but burglars were very possible, indeed.Then Margaret and David both laughed more than ever.[DIALOGUE]"What fun it would be," said David, [DIALOGUE]"for a burglar to get into thishouse and try to find something worth carrying away!"So they went on to the next night, all three fully determined to spendthe night in listening for the ghost, and running him to earth ifpossible.But it was Margaret that heard the ghost, after all. She had been
[W BOB HOLLAND]sleeping and was suddenly startled wide awake, and there, overhead, wasthe sound of the chain dragging; and just as she was on the point ofspringing out of bed to call her brother, the chain seemed to go out ofthe upper room. She lay still and listened, and in a moment she heard itagain.It was coming down the stairs.There was no carpet on the stairs, and she could hear the chain dropfrom step to step, until it had come the whole way down. There it was,
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK][TRANSITION][METAPHOR][EMOTION][HORROR]almost at the door of her room, and something that was strangely likefear kept her lying still, listening in horrified silence.Then it went along the hall, dragging close to the door; and thenfurther away; and back and forth for awhile; and then it began draggingback up the stairs again. Step by step she could hear it drawn over theedge of every step--and by the time it had reached the top sheremembered herself and called David.Again did the brother and sister make a tour of the upper room, with thelamp. Not only that, but they looked into every nook and corner of the
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE]upper part of the house, and at last came back, baffled. They had seennothing extraordinary, and they had not heard a sound.[DIALOGUE]"I’m going to see that ghost to-night," David said to his sister thenext evening.[DIALOGUE]"How?"[DIALOGUE]"I’m going to sit up all night at the head of the stairs. Don’t sayanything about it to mother; it might make her uneasy."So, after the household were all quiet, David slipped into his place atthe head of the stairs, and sat down to his vigil. He had placed ascreen at the head of the stairway so that it hid him from view--as if aghost cared for a screen--and he established himself behind it, andprepared to be as patient as he could.It seemed to him that hours so long had never been devised as those thetown clocks tolled off that night. He bore it until midnight moderately
[W BOB HOLLAND]well, because, he argued with himself, if there were any ghosts aboutthey would surely walk then; but they were not in a humor for walking;and still the hours rolled on without any developments. He took thefidgets, and had nervous twitches all over him, and at last he couldendure it no longer, and had leaned his head back against the wall andwas going blissfully to sleep when----He heard a chain dragging just beyond the open door of that unused room.In spite of himself a shiver ran down his back. There was no mistakingit; it was a real chain, if he had ever heard one. More than that, it
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE]had left the room, and was coming straight towards the stairs. The hallwas dark, and it was impossible for him to see anything, although hestrained his eyes in the direction of the sound. And even while helooked it had passed behind the screen, and was going down the stairs,dropping from step to step with a clank.Half way down a narrow strip of moonlight from a stair-window laydirectly across the steps. Whatever the thing was, it must pass through
[W BOB HOLLAND][TRANSITION][FLASHBACK]that patch of light, and David leaned forward and watched.Down it went from step to step, and presently it had slipped through thelight, and was down; and a little later it came back again, through thelight, and up the stairs, and back into that unused room.And then David slapped his knees jubilantly, and ran down to his room,and slept all the rest of the night.Next morning he was very mysterious about his discoveries of the nightbefore.
[W BOB HOLLAND][GHOST][DIALOGUE]"Oh, yes, I saw the ghost," he said to Maggie. [DIALOGUE]"There; don’t ask so manyquestions; I’ll tell you more about it to-morrow, maybe."And that was all the information she could get from him. It was veryprovoking.That day David made a purchase down town and brought home a bulkybundle, which he hid in his own room and would not let his sister evenpeep at.
[W BOB HOLLAND][GHOST][DIALOGUE]"I’m going to try to catch a ghost to-night," he said, [DIALOGUE]"and you know howit is; if I brag too much beforehand, I shall be sure to fail."He was working with something in the hall after the others had retired;but he did not sit up this time. He went to bed, and Margaret listenedat his door and found that he was soon asleep.But away in the night they were all awakened by a squealing that broughtthem all into the hall in a great hurry; and there, at the head of thestairs, they found the huge rat-trap that David had set a few hoursbefore, and in the midst of the toils was a rat.[DIALOGUE]"Why, David," exclaimed the mother, [DIALOGUE]"I didn’t know that there was a ratin the house."And then, all at once, she saw that there was a long chain hanging froma little iron collar around the creature’s neck, and she and Margaretcried together.[DIALOGUE]"And this was the ghost!"Such a funny ghost when they came to think of it--this poor rat, with anest in some hole of the broken chimney. He had been someone’s pet,once, perhaps; and now, the households he had broken up, the nights hehad disturbed, the wild sensations he had created--it made his captorslaugh to think that this innocent creature had been the cause of thewhole trouble.
[W BOB HOLLAND][GHOST][DIALOGUE]"I’ll get a cage for him, and take care of him for the rest of hislife," said David. [DIALOGUE]"We owe him so much that we can’t afford to beungrateful."The next morning he took the ghost-in-a-cage and showed it to the agent,and gave him a vivid account of the capture.[DIALOGUE]"So, you have a good house for about half price, all on account of thatrat," exclaimed the agent, grimly. "Young man--but never mind, youdeserve it. What are you working for now? Six dollars a week? If you
[W BOB HOLLAND][TRANSITION][METAPHOR][PERSPECTIVE][GHOST]ever want to change your place--suppose you come around here. I thinkyou need a business that will give you a chance to grow.[DIALOGUE]"And the agent and David shook hands warmly over the cage of the"ghost."GRAND-DAME’S GHOST STORY.BY C. D.
[W BOB HOLLAND]I don’t know whether you ever tell your children ghost stories or not;some mothers don’t, but our mother, though of German descent, wasstrong-minded on the ghost subject, and early taught all of her childrento be fearless mentally as well as physically, and, though dearly fondof hearing ghost stories, especially if they were real true ghosts, wewere sadly skeptical as to their being anything of the kind that couldharm. We were quite learned in ghostly lore, knew all about[DIALOGUE]"doppeigangers," [DIALOGUE]"Will o’ the Wisp," [DIALOGUE]"blue lights," etc., and we couldnot have a greater treat for good behavior than for our mother to drawon her store of supernatural tales for our entertainment. The story I amabout to relate she told us one stormy night, when, gathered round herchair in her own cozy sanctum, before a cheerful fire, we ate nuts andapples, and listened while she recited [DIALOGUE]"an o’er true tale," told her byher grandmother, who herself witnessed the vision:It was a fearful night, the wind sobbed and wailed round the house likelost spirits mourning their doom; the rain beat upon the casements, andthe trees, writhing in the torture of the fierce blast, groaned andswayed until their tops almost swept the earth; bright flashes oflightning pierced even through the closed shutters and heavy curtains,and the thunder had a sullen, threatening roar that made your bloodcreep. It was a night to make one seek to shut out all sound, draw the
[W BOB HOLLAND]curtains close, stir the fire and nestle deep in the arm-chair beforeit, with feet upon the fender, and have something cheerful to think ortalk about. But I was all alone; none in the house with me but theservants, and the servants’ wing was detached from the main part of thebuilding, for I do not care to have menials near me, and I had no lovedones near.It was just such a night that Nancy Black died. [DIALOGUE]"What a fearful nightfor the soul to leave its earthly home and go out into the vast, unknownfuture!" I spoke aloud, as, rousing from a train of thought, I drew myheavy mantle closer round me, wheeled my arm-chair nearer the fire, andcuddled down in it, burying my feet in the foot-cushion to warm them,for I felt strangely cold. I was in the library; it was my usual
[W BOB HOLLAND][PROBLEM][PERSPECTIVE][CONFLICT][CONTEXT][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE][CHARACTERIZATION][HAUNTED HOUSE]sitting-room, for I seldom used the parlors. What was the use? My bookswere my friends, and I loved best to be with them. My children dead, ormarried and away, the cold, grand parlors always seemed gloomy and sad;the ghosts of departed pleasures haunted them, and I cared not to enterthem.
[W BOB HOLLAND]It was a long, wide room across the hall from the parlors, running thewhole length of the house, and was lined with shelves from floor toceiling. My husband’s father had been a bibliomaniac, and my husband hadhad a leaning that way also, and the shelves held many an old rare workthat was worth its weight in gold. The fire, though burning brightly,did not illume one-half the room of which, sitting in the chimneycorner, I commanded a full view, and had been looking at the shadowsplaying on the furniture and shelves, as the flame shot up, and afterflickering a moment, would die out, leaving a gloom which would breakaway into fantastic shadows as the firelight would again shoot up.While watching the gleams of light and darkling shades, unconsciouslythe wailing of the storm outside attracted my attention, there seemed tobe odd noises of tapping on the windows, and sobs and sighs, as thoughsomeone was entreating entrance from the fierce tumult; and as I satthere, again I thought of Nancy Black, the old schoolgirl friend who hadloved me so dearly, and the night when she went forth to meet the doomappointed her; resting my head upon my hand, I sat gazing in the fire,thinking over her strange life, and still stranger death, and wonderingwhat could have become of the money and jewels that I knew she had oncepossessed.
[W BOB HOLLAND]While sitting thus, a queer sensation crept over me; it was not fear,but a feeling as though if I’d look up I’d see something frightful; ashiver, not like that of cold, ran from my head to my feet, and asensation as though someone was breathing icy cold breath upon myforehead, the same feeling you would cause by holding a piece of ice toyour cheek; it fluttered over my face and finally settled round my lips,as though the unseen one was caressing me, thrilling me with horror. ButI am not fearful, nervous nor imaginative, and resolutely throwing offthe dread that fell upon me, I turned round and looked up, and there, soclose by my side that my hand, involuntarily thrown out, passed throughher seeming form, stood Nancy Black. It was Nancy Black, and yet notNancy Black; her whole body had a semi-transparent appearance, just asyour hand looks when you hold it between yourself and a strong light;her clothing, apparently the same as worn in life, had a wavy, seething,flickering look, like flames have, and yet did not seem to burn.[DIALOGUE]"In the name of God, Nancy Black, what brought you here, and whence cameyou?" I exclaimed.A hollow whisper followed:[DIALOGUE]"Thank you, my old friend, for speaking to me, and, oh, how deeply Ithank you for thinking of me to-night--I shall have rest."Rest! I heard echoed, and a jeering laugh rang through the room that
[W BOB HOLLAND][DEATH][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][EMOTION][DANGER]made her quiver at its sound."I have been near you often; but always failed to find you in acondition when you would be en rapport before to-night. What I came forI will tell you; whence I come, you need not know; suffice it to say,that were I happy I would not be here on such an errand, nor on such anight--it is only when the elements are in a tumult, and the winds wailand moan, that we come forth. When you hear these sounds it is souls ofthe lost you hear mourning their doom--’tis then they wander up anddown, to and fro, their only release from their fearful home of tortureand undying pain.
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][HAUNTED HOUSE]"I have come to tell you that you must go over to the old house, and inthe back room I always kept locked, have the carpet taken up from towardthe fireplace. You will see a plank with a knot-hole in it. Remove that,and you will find what caused me to lose my soul--have prayers said forme, for ’tis well to pray for the dead. The money and jewels give incharity; bury in holy ground the others you find, and pray for them andme. Ah! Jeannette, you thought your old friend, though strange and odd,
[W BOB HOLLAND][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][DANGER][SURPRISE][HORROR]pure and innocent. It is a bitter part of my punishment that I mustchange your thought of me. Farewell! Do not fail me, and I shall troubleyou no more. But whenever you hear that wind howl and sweep round the
[W BOB HOLLAND]house as it does to-night, know that the lost are near. It is theirswift flight through space--fleeing before the scourge of memory andconscience--that causes that sound.[DIALOGUE]"That to-morrow you may not think you are dreaming, here is a token,"and she touched the palm of my hand with her finger-tips, and as yousee, my child, to this day, there are three crimson spots in the palm ofmy hand that nothing will eradicate.[DIALOGUE]"Do not fail me, and pray for us, Jeannette, pray," and with a longing,wistful gaze, and a deep, sobbing sigh, Nancy Black faded from my sight.[DIALOGUE]"Am I dreaming?" I exclaimed, as I rose from my chair and rang the bell.When the servant entered, I bade him attend to the fire and light thelamps, and I went through the room to see if any unusual arrangement ofthe furniture could have caused the appearance, but nothing wasapparent, and I bade him send my maid to attend me in my chamber, for Icould not help feeling unwilling to remain in the library any longerthat evening.While making my toilet for the night my maid said:[DIALOGUE]"Have you burned your hand, madam?"Glancing hastily down, I saw three dark crimson spots upon the palm ofmy left hand. They had an odd look, seared as though touched by a
[W BOB HOLLAND]red-hot iron, yet the flesh was soft, not burned and not painful. Makingsome excuse for it, I did not allude to it again, and dismissed herspeedily, that I might reflect undisturbed over the singular occurrence.There were the marks upon my hand; I could not remove them, and they didnot fade. In fact, their deep red made the rest of the palm lose itspinkish hue and look pale from the strong contrast. Could I have been
[W BOB HOLLAND]asleep and dreamed it all, and by any means have done this to myself? Ithought, but finally concluded that on the morrow I’d go over to NancyBlack’s old residence and settle the question; and with that conclusionhad to content myself until the morrow came.Nancy Black was an old friend from my girlhood, who had owned largeproperty in the town, and lived all alone in a spacious stone housedirectly opposite my home, and who, when dying, had left me the solelegatee of her property.When morning came I took the keys, and, with my maid, went over toNancy’s house. It had never been disturbed since her death, which was
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][HORROR]sudden and somewhat singular, and the furniture remained just as sheleft it when taken to her last resting place. We went to the room Nancyhad directed. I bade Sarah take up the carpet, and, sure enough, therewas a plank with a knot-hole in it; so I sent her from the room, andlifted the plank myself, and there, between the two joints, rested along box, the lid not fastened. Opening it, I was horrified to see twoskeletons--those of an infant and of a woman, small in stature anddelicate frame. In a moment it flashed before me that I saw all that
[W BOB HOLLAND][MURDER]remained of Nancy Black’s young sister, a girl of seventeen, who hadleft home somewhat mysteriously years ago, and had died while absent--atleast, that was the version Nancy had given of her absence, and no onehad dreamed of doubting it, her tale was so naturally told.Left orphans when Lucy was only two years and Nancy eighteen, she haddevoted her life to the care of this young girl, and when she found hersister had fallen, she, in her pride of name and position, had destroyedmother and child, that her shame might not be known, and had lived allthose dreary years in that house with her fearful secret.Round the box, heaped up on every side, were money and jewels, and aparchment scroll among them had written on it: [DIALOGUE]"Lucy’s share of ourfather’s estate." I carried out Nancy’s wishes to the letter, for I nowfirmly believed that she had come to me herself that night. To avoidscandal resting on the dead, I took our clergyman into my confidence,and with his assistance had the remains buried quietly in consecratedground. The money and jewels were given to the poor, and the old
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][TRANSITION][DANGER][EMOTION][GHOST]building I turned into a home for destitute females; and morning andnight, as I kneel in prayer, I pray forgiveness to rest upon Nancy Blackand peace to her troubled soul.A FIGHT WITH A GHOST.BY Q. E. D.
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][DIALOGUE]"No, I never believed much in ghosts," said the doctor. [DIALOGUE]"But I wasalways rather afraid of them."[DIALOGUE]"Have you ever seen one?" asked one of the other men.The doctor took his cigar out of his mouth and contemplated the ash fora moment or two before replying. [DIALOGUE]"I have had some rather startlingexperiences," he said, after a pause, during which the rest of usexchanged glances, for the doctor has seen many things and is not averseto talking about them in congenial company. "Would you care about
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK]hearing one of them? It gives me the cold shivers now to speak of it.[DIALOGUE]"We nodded, and the doctor, taking a sip as an antidote to the shivers,began:"You remember George Carson, who played for the ‘Varsity some years ago;big chap, with a light mustache? Well, I saw a good deal of him beforehe married, while he was reading for the bar in town. It was just after
[W BOB HOLLAND][TRANSITION][EMOTION][ACTION][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][CHARACTER][RESOLUTION][PROBLEM]he became engaged to Miss Stonor, who is now Mrs. Carson, that he askedme to go down to a place which his people had taken in the country. MissStonor was to be there and he wanted me to meet her. I could not go downfor Christmas Day, as I had promised to be with my people. But as I hadbeen working a bit too hard, and wanted a few days’ rest, I decided torun down for a few days about the New Year.
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][EMOTION]"Woodcote was a pleasant enough place to look at. There were two packsof hounds within easy distance, and it was not far enough from a stationto cut you off completely from the morning papers. The Carsons had beenlucky, I thought, in coming across such a good house at such a moderatefigure. For, as George told me, the owner had been obliged to go abroadfor his health, and was anxious not to leave the place empty all thewinter. It was an old house, with big gables and preposterous corners
[W BOB HOLLAND]all over the place, and you couldn’t walk ten paces along any of thepassages without tumbling up or down stairs. But it had been patchedfrom time to time and, among other improvements, a big billiard-room hadbeen built out at the back. A country house in the winter without abilliard-room, when the frost stops hunting, is just--well, not even agilded prison. The party was a small one; besides George and his fatherand mother, there were only a couple of Misses Carson, who, beingsomewhere in the early teens, didn’t count, and Miss Stonor, who, ofcourse, counted a good deal, and, lastly, myself.
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][PERSPECTIVE][EMOTION][CHARACTER][CONTEXT][METAPHOR]"Miss Stonor ought to have been happy, for George Carson, besides beingan excellent fellow all around, was by no means a bad match, being anonly son with considerable expectations. But, somehow or other, she didnot strike me as looking either very well or very happy. She gave me theimpression of having something on her mind, which made her alternatelynervous and listless. George, I fancied, noticed it, and was puzzled byit, for I caught him several times watching her with an anxious andinquiring look, but, as I was not there as a doctor, of course it was nobusiness of mine, though I discovered the reason before I left Woodcote.
[W BOB HOLLAND][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE]"The second night after my arrival--we had been playing, I remember, afamily pool; the rest had gone upstairs to bed--George and I adjournedto a sort of study, which he had arranged upstairs, for a final smokeand a chat before turning in. The study was next to his bedroom, andparted off from it by curtains. As we were settling down I missed mypipe, and remembered that I had laid it down in the billiard-room. Onprinciple I never smoke another man’s pipe, so I lit a candle, the housebeing in darkness, and started away in search of my own. The house
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][METAPHOR][HORROR]looked awfully weird by the flickering light of a solitary candle, andthe stairs creaked in a particularly gruesome way behind me, just forall the world as though someone were following at my heels. I found mypipe where I had expected in the billiard-room, and came back in perhapsa little more hurry than was absolutely necessary. Which, perhaps,explains why I stumbled in the uncertain light over a couple ofunforeseen stairs, and dropped my candle. Of course it went out, butafter a little groping I found it. Having no matches with me I was
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE]obliged to feel my way along the banisters, for it was so dark that Icould not see my hand in front of me. And as I slowly advanced, slidingmy hand along the broad balustrade at my side, it suddenly slid oversomething cold and clammy, which was not balustrade at all; for,stopping dead, and closing my fingers round it for an instant, I feltthat I was holding another hand, a skinny, bony hand, which writheditself slowly from my grasp. And though I could hear nothing and seenothing, I was yet conscious that something was brushing past me andgoing up the stairs."‘Hi--what’s that? Who are you?’ I called.
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][EXPOSITION][SURPRISE][DIALOGUE]"There was no answer."I admit that I was in a regular funk. I must have shown it in my face."‘What’s the matter?’ asked George, as I blundered into his study.
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][DIALOGUE]"‘Oh, nothing,’ I answered; ‘dropped my candle and lost the way.’"‘But who were you talking to?’[DIALOGUE]"‘I was only swearing at the candle,’ I replied."‘Oh! I thought perhaps you had seen--somebody,’ replied George.
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][EMOTION][DIALOGUE]"Somehow I did not like to tell him the truth, for fear he would laughat my nervousness. But I determined to keep an eye on my liver, and takea couple of weeks’ complete rest. That night I woke up several timeswith the feeling of that confounded hand under my own--a clammy handwhich writhed as my fingers closed upon it."The next morning after breakfast I was in the billiard-room practicingstrokes while Carson was over at the stables. Presently the door opened,and Miss Stonor looked in."‘Come in,’ I said; ‘George will be back from the stables in a fewminutes. Meanwhile we can have fifty up.’
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][DIALOGUE]"‘I wanted to speak to you,’ she said."She was looking very tired and ill, and I began to think I should nothave an uninterrupted holiday after all.[DIALOGUE]"‘Do you believe in ghosts?’ she asked, having closed the door and comeup to the table, where she stood leaning with both her hands upon it."‘No,’ I replied, missing an easy carrom as I remembered my experienceof last night, ‘but I believe in fancy.’[DIALOGUE]"‘And, supposing then that a person fancied he saw things, is there anyremedy?’"‘What do you mean, Miss Stonor?’ I replied, looking at her in somesurprise. ‘Do you mean that you fancy----’
[W BOB HOLLAND][EMOTION][DIALOGUE]"I stopped, for Miss Stonor turned away, sat down on one of theeasy-chairs by the wall, and burst into tears."‘Oh! please help me’ she sobbed; ‘I believe I am going mad.’[DIALOGUE]"I laid down my cue and went over to her."‘Look here, Miss Stonor,’ I said, taking her hand, which was hot andfeverish, ‘I am a doctor, and a friend of George. Now tell me all aboutit, and I’ll do my best to set it right.’
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][EMOTION][HORROR]"She was in a more or less hysterical condition, and her words werefreely punctuated by sobs. But gradually I managed to elicit from herthat nearly every night since she came to Woodcote she had been awakenedin some mysterious way, and had seen a horrible face looking at her fromover the top of a screen which stood by the door of her bedroom. As soonas she moved the face disappeared, which convinced her that theapparition existed only in her imagination. That seemed to distress hereven more than if she had believed it to be a genuine ghost, for shethought her brain was giving way.
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][RELIEF][FLASHBACK][EMOTION][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][GORE]"I told her that she was only suffering from a very common symptom ofnervous disorder, as indeed it was, and promised to send a groom intothe village to get a prescription made up for her. And, having made mepromise to breathe no word to anyone on the subject, more especially toGeorge, she went away relieved. Nevertheless, I was not quite certainthat I had made a correct diagnosis of the case. You see I had beenrather upset myself not many hours before. George was longer than I
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][FLASHBACK][PROBLEM][PERSPECTIVE][ACTION][EMOTION]expected at the stable, and I was just going to find him when at thedoor I met Mrs. Carson."‘Can you spare me one moment?’ she said, as I held open the door forher. ‘I wanted to find you alone.’
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][DIALOGUE]"‘Certainly, Mrs. Carson, with pleasure; an hour, if you wish,’ Ireplied."‘It is so convenient, you know, to have a doctor in the house,’ shesaid, with a nervous laugh. ‘Now I want you to prescribe me a sleepingdraught. My nerves are rather out of order, and--I don’t sleep as Ishould.’"‘Ah,’ I said, ‘do you see faces--and such like things when you wake?’
[W BOB HOLLAND][DANGER][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][DIALOGUE]"‘How do you know?’ she asked quickly."‘Oh, I inferred from the other symptoms. We doctors have to observe allkinds of little things.’"‘Well, of course, I know it is only fancy; but it is just as bad as ifit were real. I assure you it is making me quite ill; and I didn’t liketo mention it to Mr. Carson or to George. They would think I was losingmy head.’
[W BOB HOLLAND][PERSPECTIVE][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][DANGER][CONTEXT][GORE]"I gave Mrs. Carson the same prescription as I had written for MissStonor, though by that time the conviction had grown upon me that therewas something wrong which could not be cured by medicine. However, Idecided to say nothing to George about the matter at present. For Icould hardly utilize the confidence which had been placed in me by MissStonor and Mrs. Carson. And my own experience of the night before wouldscarcely have appeared convincing to him. But I determined that on the
[W BOB HOLLAND][TRANSITION][SURPRISE]next day--which was Sunday--I would invent an excuse for staying at homefrom church and make some explorations in the house. There was obviouslysome mystery at work which wanted clearing up."We all sat up rather late that night. There seemed to be a generaldisinclination to go to bed. We stayed all together in the billiard-room
[W BOB HOLLAND][TRANSITION]until nearly midnight, and then loitered about in the hall, talking inan aimless sort of fashion. But at last Mrs. Carson said good-night,with a confidential nod to me, and Miss Stonor murmured, ‘So manythanks; I’ve got it,’ and they both went upstairs. George and I partedin the corridor above. Our rooms were opposite each other.
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][DANGER][PROBLEM][SUSPENSE][HORROR]"I did not begin undressing at once, but sat down and tried to piecetogether some theory to account for the uncanniness of things. But themore I thought, the more perplexing it became. There was no doubtwhatever that I had put my hand on something extremely alive andextremely unpleasant the night before. The bare recollection of it mademe shudder. What living thing could possibly be creeping about the house
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][DANGER][WEAPON][METAPHOR][CONFLICT]in the dark? It was a man’s hand. Of that I was certain from the size ofit. George Carson was out of the question, for he was in his room allthe time. Nor was it likely that Mr. Carson, senior, would steal about
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][PROBLEM]his own house in his socks and refuse to answer when spoken to. The onlyother man in the house was an eminently respectable-looking butler; andhis hand, as I had noted particularly when he poured out my wine atdinner, was plump and soft, whereas the mysterious hand on thebalustrade was thin and bony. And then, what was the real explanation ofthe face which had appeared to the two ladies? Indigestion might haveexplained either singly. Extraordinary coincidences do sometimes occur,
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][EMOTION][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][DANGER]but it seemed too extraordinary that a couple of ladies--one old and oneyoung--should suffer from the same indigestion in the same house, at thesame time, and with the same symptoms. On the whole, I did not feel atall comfortable, and looked carefully in all the cupboards and recesses,as well as under the bed, before starting to undress. Then I went to thedoor, intending to lock it. Just as my hand was upon the key, I heard asoft step in the corridor outside, accompanied by a sound which wassomething between a sigh and a groan. Very faint, but quiteunmistakable, and, under the circumstances, discomposing. It might, of
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][TRANSITION][ACTION][GORE]course, be George. Anyhow, I decided to look and see. I turned thehandle gently and opened the door. There was nothing to be seen in thecorridor. But on the opposite side I could see a door open, and George’s
[W BOB HOLLAND][PERSPECTIVE][SURPRISE][ACTION][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][FLASHBACK][CONTEXT][EMOTION]head peeping round the corner.[DIALOGUE]"‘Hullo!’ he said."‘Hullo!’ I replied."‘Was that you walking up the passage?’ he asked.
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][PERSPECTIVE][PROBLEM][TRANSITION][METAPHOR][CONTEXT][DIALOGUE]"‘No,’ I answered, ‘I thought it might be you.’"‘Then who the devil was it?’ he said. ‘I’ll swear I heard someone.’
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][DANGER][CONFLICT][PERSPECTIVE][EMOTION][HORROR][DIALOGUE]"There was silence for a few moments. I was wondering whether I hadbetter tell him of the fright I had already had, when he spoke again:"‘I say, just come here for a bit, old fellow; I want to speak to you.’[DIALOGUE]"I stepped across the passage, and we went together into the littlestudy which adjoined his bedroom."‘Look here,’ he said, poking up the fire, which was burning low,‘doesn’t it strike you that there is something very odd about thishouse?’[DIALOGUE]"‘You mean----’"‘Well, I wouldn’t say anything about it to the master or Miss Stonorfor fear of frightening them. All the same, scarcely a night passes but
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK][PERSPECTIVE][CONTEXT][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][EMOTION][DANGER][TRANSITION][HORROR]I hear curious footsteps on the stairs. You’ve heard them yourself,haven’t you?’[DIALOGUE]"‘Now you mention it,’ I said, ‘I confess I have.’"‘And, what is more,’ he continued, ‘I was sitting here two nights agohalf asleep, and--it seems ridiculous, I know, but it’s a fact--Isuddenly saw a horrible face glaring at me from between those curtainsbehind you. It was gone in a moment, but I saw it as plainly as I see
[W BOB HOLLAND][TRANSITION]you.’[DIALOGUE]"I moved my seat uneasily."‘Did you look in your bedroom or in the passage?’ I asked."‘Yes--at once,’ he replied. ‘There was nothing to be seen; but twice
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK]again that night I heard footsteps passing--good God!’[DIALOGUE]"He started up in his chair, staring straight over my shoulder. I turnedquickly and saw the curtains which parted off the bedroom swingtogether."‘What is it?’ I asked, breathlessly."‘I saw it again--the same face--between the curtains.’
[W BOB HOLLAND][TRANSITION][ACTION][GORE]"I tore the hangings aside, and rushed into the next room. It was empty.The lamp was burning upon a side table, and the door was open, just asGeorge had left it. In the passage outside all was quiet. I came back
[W BOB HOLLAND][DANGER][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][HORROR]into the study and found George running his fingers through his hair inperplexity.[DIALOGUE]"‘There is clearly one person too many in the house,’ I said. ‘I thinkwe ought to draw the place and find out who it is.’"‘All right,’ said he, picking up the poker from the fireplace; ‘if it’sanything made of flesh and blood this will be useful, and if not----’"He stopped short, for at that instant the most awful shriek of horrorrang through the house--a shriek of wild, uncontrollable terror, such asI had never heard before and I never hope to hear again. One moment we
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][DANGER][HORROR]stood staring at each other, dumbfounded. The next George Carson haddashed out of the room and down the corridor to the stairs. I followedclose behind him. For we both knew that none but a woman in mortal fearwould shriek like that, and that that woman was Miss Stonor.
[W BOB HOLLAND][FLASHBACK][TRANSITION][DANGER][EMOTION]"Down the stairs we tumbled pell-mell in the darkness. But before Ireached the landing below, where Miss Stonor’s room was, I felt, as Ihad felt the evening before, something brush swiftly past me. As I ran Iturned and caught at it in the dark. But my hand gripped only empty air.
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][DANGER][FLASHBACK]I was just about to turn back and follow it, when a cry from Georgearrested me, and, looking down, I saw him standing over the prostrateform of Miss Stonor. The door of her room was open, and by the moonlightwhich streamed into the room I could see her lying in her whitenightdress across the threshold. What followed in the next few minutesI can scarcely recall with accuracy. The whole house was aroused by thepoor girl’s awful shriek. She was quite unconscious when we came upon
[W BOB HOLLAND]her, but she revived more or less as soon as Mrs. Carson and one of theterrified servants had lifted her into bed again. Nothing intelligiblecould be gathered from her, however, as to the cause of her fright; sheonly repeated, hysterically, again and again:[DIALOGUE]"‘Oh, the face; the face!’"When I saw I could do her no further good for the present, I tookGeorge by the arm and led him out of the room."‘Look here, George,’ I said, ‘we must find out the reason of this atonce. I am certain I felt something go by me as I came downstairs. Now
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][GORE]does that staircase lead anywhere but to our rooms?’[DIALOGUE]"George considered for a moment."‘Yes,’ he replied; ‘there is a door at the end of the passage whichleads up into a sort of lumber room.’"‘Then we’ll explore it,’ I said. ‘For my part I can’t go to sleep untilI’ve got to the bottom of this. Get the man to bring a lantern along.’
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][ACTION][CONTEXT][DANGER][PROBLEM][HORROR]"The butler looked as though he didn’t half like the enterprise, and, totell the truth, no more did I. It was the uncanniest job I everundertook. However, we started, the three of us. First of all wesearched the rooms on the floor above, where George and I slept.
[W BOB HOLLAND]Everything was just as we had left it. Then I pushed open the door atthe end of the corridor. A crazy-looking staircase led up into darkness.We went cautiously up, I first with a candle, then George, and last ofall the butler with a lantern. At the top we stepped into a big, rather
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE]low room, with beams across the ceiling, and a rough, uneven floor. Ourlights threw strange shadows into the corners, and more than once Istarted at what looked like a crouching human figure. We searched everycorner. There was nothing to be seen but a few old boxes, a roll or twoof matting, and some broken chairs. But in the far corner George pointed
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][EMOTION][PROBLEM][CONFLICT]out to me a rickety ladder which ended at a closed trap-door. Just thenI distinctly heard the curious, half groaning, half sighing sound whichhad already puzzled me in the corridor below. We stood still and lookedat one another. We all heard the sound.
[W BOB HOLLAND][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][SUSPENSE][METAPHOR][TRANSITION][DIALOGUE]"‘Whatever it is, it’s up there,’ I said. ‘The question is, who is goingup?’"George put his candle down upon the floor and stepped upon the ladder.It cracked beneath his weight. He stopped.
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][EMOTION][SURPRISE][DANGER][HORROR][DIALOGUE]"‘Come down; it won’t bear you,’ I said. ‘I shall have to go.’"I don’t know that I was ever in such a queer funk as I was while Islowly mounted that ladder, and pushed open the trap-door. I had formedno clear idea of what I expected to find there. Certainly I was not
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][DANGER][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][ACTION][EMOTION][FLASHBACK][TRANSITION][HORROR]prepared for what happened. For no sooner was the trap-door fully openthan there fell--literally fell--upon me from the darkness above a thingin human shape, which kicked and spat and tore at me as I stood clingingto the ladder. It lasted but a moment or so, but in that moment I liveda lifetime of terror. The ladder swayed and cracked beneath me, and Ifell to the floor with the thing gripping my throat like a vise. The

And the mystery was solved.[DIALOGUE]""But you haven’t told us what it really was," said one of the listeners.

Hehad gone to a private lunatic asylum with homicidal mania upon him.About a fortnight before this he had managed to escape; and, having madehis way to his former home, had concealed himself, with a cunning oftenshown by lunatics, in the loft. I suppose he had found enough to eat in

The only wonder is that he didn’tkill someone before he was caught."COLONEL HALIFAX’S GHOST STORY.I had just come back to England, after having been some years in India,and was looking forward to meet my friends, among whom there was none Iwas more anxious to see than Sir Francis Lynton. We had been to Eton
[W BOB HOLLAND][FLASHBACK]together, and for the short time I had been at Oxford, before enteringthe army, we had been at the same college. Then we had parted. He cameinto the title and estates of the family in Yorkshire on the death ofhis grandfather--his father had predeceased--and I had been over a goodpart of the world. One visit, indeed, I had made him in his Yorkshirehome, before leaving for India, of but a few days.
[W BOB HOLLAND][METAPHOR][SURPRISE]It will be easily imagined how pleasant it was, two or three days aftermy arrival in London, to receive a letter from Lynton, saying that hehad just seen in the papers that I had arrived, and, begging me to comedown at once to Byfield, his place in Yorkshire.[DIALOGUE]"You are not to tell me," he said, [DIALOGUE]"that you cannot come. In fact, youare to come on Monday. I have a couple of horses which will just suityou; the carriage shall meet you at Packham, and all you have got to dois to put yourself in the train which leaves Kings Cross at twelveo’clock."Accordingly, on the day appointed, I started, in due time reachedPackham, losing much time on a detestable branch line, and there foundthe dog-cart of Sir Francis awaiting me. I drove at once to Byfield.The house I remembered. It was a low gable structure of no great size,with old-fashioned lattice windows, separated from the park, where weredeer, by a charming terraced garden.
[W BOB HOLLAND][EMOTION]No sooner did the wheels crunch the gravel by the principal entrance,than, almost before the bell was rung, the porch-door opened, and therestood Lynton himself, whom I had not seen for so many years, hardlyaltered, and with all the joy of welcome beaming in his face. Taking meby both hands, he drew me into the house, got rid of my hat and wraps,looked me all over, and then, in a breath, began to say how glad he wasto see me, what a real delight it was to have got me at last under hisroof, and what a good time we would have together, like the old daysover again.He had sent my luggage up to my room, which was ready for me, and hebade me make haste and dress for dinner.So saying he took me through a paneled hall, up an old oak staircase,and showed me my room, which, hurried as I was, I observed was hungwith tapestry, and had a large four-post bed, with velvet curtains,opposite the window.
[W BOB HOLLAND]They had gone in to dinner when I came down, despite all the haste Imade in dressing; but a place had been kept for me next Lady Lynton.Besides my hosts, there were their two daughters, Colonel Lynton, abrother of Sir Francis, the chaplain, and some others, whom I do notremember distinctly.After dinner there was some music in the hall, and a game of whist inthe drawing-room, and after the ladies had gone upstairs, Lynton and Iretired to the smoking-room, where we sat up talking the better part ofthe night. I think it must have been near three when I retired. Once in
[W BOB HOLLAND]bed I slept so soundly that my servant’s entrance the next morningfailed to arouse me, and it was past nine when I awoke.After breakfast and the disposal of the newspapers, Lynton retired tohis letters, and I asked Lady Lynton if one of her daughters might showme the house. Elizabeth, the eldest, was summoned, and seemed in no wayto dislike the task.The house was, as already intimated, by no means large; it occupiedthree sides of a square, the entrance and one end of the stables makingthe fourth side. The interior was full of interest--passages, rooms,
[W BOB HOLLAND][TRANSITION][CHARACTERIZATION][CONFLICT][HORROR]galleries, as well as hall, were paneled in dark wood and hung withpictures. I was shown everything on the ground[Illustration: [DIALOGUE]"_Losing much time on a detestable branch line._"]floor, and then on the first floor. Then my guide proposed that weshould ascend a narrow, twisting staircase that led to a gallery. We did
[W BOB HOLLAND]as proposed, and entered a handsome long room or passage leading to asmall chamber at one end, in which my guide told me her father keptbooks and papers.I asked if anyone slept in this gallery, as I noticed a bed andfireplace, and rods by means of which curtains might be drawn, enclosingone portion where were bed and fireplace, so as to convert it into avery cosy chamber.She answered [DIALOGUE]"No;" the place was not really used, except as a playroom;though, sometimes, if the house happened to be very full--in hergreat-grandfather’s time--she had heard that it had been occupied.By the time we had been over the house, and I had also been shown thegarden and the stables, and introduced to the dogs, it was nearly oneo’clock. We were to have an early luncheon, and to drive afterwards to
[W BOB HOLLAND]see the ruins of one of the grand old Yorkshire abbeys.This was a pleasant expedition, and we got back just in time for tea,after which there was some reading aloud. The evening passed much in thesame way as the preceding one, except that Lynton, who had somebusiness, did not go down into the smoking-room, and I took theopportunity of retiring early in order to write a letter for the Indianmail, something having been said as to the prospect of hunting the nextday.I had finished my letter, which was a long one, together with two orthree others, and had just got into bed, when I heard a step overhead,as of someone walking along the gallery, which I now knew ranimmediately above my room. It was a slow, heavy, measured tread which I
[W BOB HOLLAND][TRANSITION][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE]could hear getting gradually louder and nearer, and then as graduallyfading away, as it retreated into the distance.I was startled for a moment, having been told that the gallery wasunused; but the next instant it occurred to me that I had been told itcommunicated with a chamber where Sir Francis kept books and papers. Iknew he had some writing to do, and I thought no more on the matter.I was down the next morning at breakfast in good time. "How late you
[W BOB HOLLAND]were last night,[DIALOGUE]" I said to Lynton, in the middle of breakfast. "I heardyou overhead after one o’clock.[DIALOGUE]"Lynton replied rather shortly: "Indeed you did not, for I was in bedlast night before twelve.[DIALOGUE]""There was someone certainly moving overhead last night,[DIALOGUE]" I answered,"for I heard his steps as distinctly as I ever heard anything in my lifegoing down the gallery."Upon which Colonel Lynton remarked that he had often fancied he hadheard steps on the staircase, when he knew that no one was about. He wasapparently disposed to say more, when his brother interrupted himsomewhat curtly, as I fancied, and asked me if I should feel inclinedafter breakfast to have a horse and go out and look for the hounds. Theymet a considerable way off, but if they did not find in the coverts theywould first draw, a thing not improbable, they would come our way, andwe might fall in with them about one o’clock and have a run. I said
[W BOB HOLLAND]there was nothing I should like better. Lynton mounted me on a very nicechestnut, and the rest of the party having gone out shooting, and theyoung ladies being otherwise engaged, he and I started about eleveno’clock for our ride.It was a beautiful day, soft, with a bright sun, one of those beautifuldays which so frequently occur in the early part of November.On reaching the hilltop where Lynton had expected to meet the hounds, notrace of them was to be discovered. They must have found at once, and
[W BOB HOLLAND]run in a different direction. At three o’clock, after we had eaten oursandwiches, Lynton reluctantly abandoned all hopes of falling in withthe hounds, and said we would return home by a slightly different route.We had not descended the hill before we came on an old chalk quarry andthe remains of a disused kiln.I recollected the spot at once. I had been here with Sir Francis on my
[W BOB HOLLAND][FLASHBACK]former visit, many years ago. [DIALOGUE]"Why, bless me!" said I; [DIALOGUE]"do you remember,Lynton, what happened here when I was with you before? There had beenmen engaged removing chalk, and they came on a skeleton under some depthof rubble. We went together to see it removed, and you said you wouldhave it preserved till it could be examined by some ethnologist oranthropologist, any one of those dry-as-dusts, to decide whether theremains were dolichocephalous or brachycephalous--whether British,Danish, or--modern. What was the result?"Sir Francis hesitated a moment, and then answered, [DIALOGUE]"It is true, I hadthe remains removed."[DIALOGUE]"Was there an inquest?""No. I had been opening some of the tumuli on the Wolds. I had sent acrouched skeleton and some skulls to the Scarsborough museum. This, I
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][DEATH][METAPHOR][DANGER][PROBLEM][CONFLICT]was doubtful about--whether it was a prehistoric interment--in fact, towhat date it belonged. No one thought of an inquest.[DIALOGUE]"On reaching the house, one of the grooms who took the horses, in answerto a question from Lynton, said that Colonel and Mrs. Hampshire hadarrived about an hour ago, and that, one of the horses being lame, thecarriage in which they had driven over from Castle Frampton was to putup for the night. In the drawing-room we found Lady Lynton pouring outtea for her husband’s sister and her husband, who, as we came in,exclaimed: "We have come to beg a night’s lodging."It appeared that they had been on a visit in the neighborhood, and hadbeen obliged to leave at a moment’s notice in consequence of a suddendeath in the house where they were staying, and that, in theimpossibility of getting a fly, their hosts had sent them over toByfield.
[W BOB HOLLAND][DIALOGUE]"We thought," Mrs. Hampshire went on to say, [DIALOGUE]"that as we were cominghere the end of next week, you would not mind having us a little sooner;or that, if the house were quite full, you would be willing to put us upanywhere till Monday, and let us come back later."Lady Lynton interposed with the remark that it was all settled; andthen, turning to her husband, added: [DIALOGUE]"But I want to speak to you for amoment."They both left the room together.Lynton came back almost immediately, and, making an excuse to show me,on a map in the hall, the point to which we had ridden, said, as soon aswe were alone, with a look of considerable annoyance: "I am afraid wemust ask you to change your room. Shall you mind very much? I think wecan make you quite comfortable upstairs in the gallery, which is theonly room available. Lady Lynton has had a good fire lit; the place is
[W BOB HOLLAND]really not cold, and it will be only for a night or two. Your servanthas been told to put your things together, but Lady Lynton did not liketo give orders to have them actually moved before my speaking to you."I assured him that I did not mind in the very least; that I should bequite as comfortable upstairs; but that I did mind very much theirmaking such a fuss about a matter of that sort with an old friend likemyself.Certainly nothing could look more comfortable than my new lodging when Iwent upstairs to dress. There was a bright fire in the large grate, an
[W BOB HOLLAND][TRANSITION][EMOTION][PERSPECTIVE]arm-chair had been drawn up beside it, and all my books and writingthings had been put in, with a reading-lamp in the central position, andthe heavy tapestry curtains were drawn, converting this part of thegallery into a room to itself. Indeed, I felt somewhat inclined tocongratulate myself on the change. The spiral staircase had been onereason against this place having been given to the Hampshires. No lady’slong dress trunk could have mounted it.
[W BOB HOLLAND]Sir Francis was necessarily a good deal occupied in the evening with hissister and her husband, whom he had not seen for some time. ColonelHampshire had also just heard that he was likely to be ordered to Egypt,and when Lynton and he retired to the smoking-room, instead of goingthere I went upstairs to my own room to finish a book in which I wasinterested. I did not, however, sit up long, and very soon went to bed.Before doing so, I drew back the curtains on the rods, partly because Ilike plenty of air where I sleep, and partly also because I thought Imight like to see the play of the moonlight on the floor in the portionof the gallery beyond where I lay, and where the blinds had not beendrawn.
[W BOB HOLLAND]I must have been asleep for some time, for the fire, which I had left infull blaze, was gone to a few sparks wandering among the ashes, when Isuddenly awoke with the impression of having heard a latch click at thefurther extremity of the gallery, where was the chamber containing booksand papers.I had always been a light sleeper, but on the present occasion I woke atonce to complete and acute consciousness, and with a sense of stretchedattention which seemed to intensify all my faculties. The wind hadrisen, and was blowing in fitful gusts round the house.A minute or two passed, and I began almost to fancy I must have beenmistaken, when I distinctly heard the creak of the door, and then theclick of the latch falling back into place. Then I heard a sound on the
[W BOB HOLLAND][METAPHOR][TRANSITION][SURPRISE]boards as of one moving in the gallery. I sat up to listen, and as I didso I distinctly heard steps coming down the gallery.[Illustration: [DIALOGUE]"_Who are you?_"]I heard them approach and pass my bed; I could see nothing, all wasdark; but I heard the tread proceeding toward where were the uncurtainedand unshuttered windows, two in number; but the moon shone through onlyone of these, the nearest--the other was dark, shadowed by the chapel orsome other building at right angles. The tread seemed to me to pause now
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][FLASHBACK][METAPHOR]and again, and then continue as before.I now fixed my eyes intently on the one illumined window, and itappeared to me as if some dark body passed across it; but what? Ilistened intently, and heard the step proceed to the end of the gallery,and then return.I again watched the lighted window, and immediately that the soundreached that portion of the long passage it ceased momentarily, and Isaw, as distinctly as I ever saw anything in my life, by moonlight, afigure of a man with marked features, in what appeared to be a fur capdrawn over the brows.
[W BOB HOLLAND][EMOTION][SURPRISE][DANGER][TRANSITION][FLASHBACK][CONFLICT][HORROR]It stood in the embrasure of the window, and the outline of the face wasin silhouette; then it moved on, and as it moved I again heard thetread.I was as certain as I could be that the thing, whatever it was, or theperson, whoever he was, was approaching my bed.I threw myself back in the bed, and as I did see a mass of charred woodon the hearth fell down and sent up a flash of--I fancy sparks, thatgave out a glare into the darkness, and by that--red as blood--I saw aface near me.With a cry, over which I had as little control as the scream uttered bya sleeper in the agony of a nightmare, I called, [DIALOGUE]"Who are you?"There was an instant during which my hair bristled on my head, as in thehorror of the darkness I prepared to grapple with the being at my side;when a board creaked as if someone had moved, and I heard the footstepsretreat, and again the click of the latch.
[W BOB HOLLAND]The next instant there was a rush on the stairs and Lynton burst intothe room, just as he had sprung out of bed, crying: [DIALOGUE]"For God’s sake,what is the matter? Are you ill?"I could not answer. Lynton struck a light and leaned over the bed. ThenI seized him by the arm, and said, without moving: [DIALOGUE]"There has beensomething in this room--gone in thither."The words were hardly out of my mouth when Lynton, following thedirection of my eyes, had sprung to the end of the corridor and thrownopen the door there.He went into the room beyond, looked round it, returned, and said: [DIALOGUE]"Youmust have been dreaming."By this time I was out of bed.
[W BOB HOLLAND][DANGER][CONFLICT][DIALOGUE]"Look for yourself," said he, and he led me into the little room. It wasbare, with cupboards and boxes, a sort of lumber place. [DIALOGUE]"There isnothing beyond this," said he, [DIALOGUE]"no door, no staircase. It is a blindway." Then he added: [DIALOGUE]"Now pull on your dressing-gown and come downstairsto my sanctum."I followed him, and after he had spoken to Lady Lynton, who was standingwith the door of her room ajar in a state of great agitation, he turnedto me, and said: "No one can have been in your room. You see, my and mywife’s apartments are close below, and no one could come up the spiralstaircase without passing my door. You must have had a nightmare.
[W BOB HOLLAND]Directly you screamed I rushed up the steps, and met no one descending;and there is no place of concealment in the lumber-room at the end ofthe gallery.[DIALOGUE]"Then he took me into his private snuggery, blew up the fire, lighted alamp, and said: "I shall be really grateful if you will say nothingabout this. There are some in the house and neighborhood who are sillyenough as it is. You stay here, and if you do not feel inclined to go tobed, read--here are books. I must go to Lady Lynton, who is a good deal
[W BOB HOLLAND][DANGER][PROBLEM][CONFLICT]frightened, and does not like to be left alone."He then went to his bedroom.Sleep, as far as I was concerned, was out of the question, nor do Ithink Sir Francis and his wife slept much, either.I made up the fire, and after a time took up a book, and tried to read,but it was useless.
[W BOB HOLLAND]I sat absorbed in thoughts and questionings till I heard the servantsstirring in the morning. I went to my own room, left the candle burning,and got into bed. I had just fallen asleep when my servant brought me acup of tea at eight o’clock.At breakfast Colonel Hampshire and his wife asked if anything hadhappened in the night, as they had been much disturbed by noisesoverhead, to which Lynton replied that I had not been very well, and hadan attack of cramp, and that he had been upstairs to look after me. From
[W BOB HOLLAND]his manner I could see that he wished me to be silent, and I saidnothing accordingly.In the afternoon, when everyone had gone out, Sir Francis took me intohis snuggery, and said: "Halifax, I am very sorry about that matter lastnight. It is quite true, what my brother said, that steps have beenheard about this house, but I never gave heed to such things, puttingall noises down to rats. But after your experiences I feel that it isdue to you to tell you something, and also to make to you anexplanation. There is--there was--no one in the room at the end of the
[W BOB HOLLAND]corridor, except the skeleton that was discovered in the chalk-pit whenyou were here many years ago. I confess I had not paid much heed to it.My archæological fancies passed; I had no visits from anthropologists;the bones and skull were never shown to experts, but remain packed in achest in that lumber-room. I confess I ought to have buried them, havingno more scientific use for them, but I did not--on my word, I forgot allabout them, or, at least, gave no heed to them. However, what you have
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][DEATH]gone through, and have described to me, has made me uneasy, and has alsogiven me a suspicion that I can account for that body in a manner thathad never occurred to me before.[DIALOGUE]"After a pause, he added: "What I am going to tell you is known to no oneelse, and must not be mentioned by you--anyhow, in my lifetime. You knownow that, owing to the death of my father when quite young, I and mybrother and sister were brought up here with our grandfather, SirRichard. He was an old, imperious, hot-tempered man. I will tell you
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][DANGER][CHARACTER][METAPHOR][CONFLICT][CHARACTERIZATION][FLASHBACK]what I have made out of a matter that was a mystery for long, and I willtell you afterwards how I came to unravel it. My grandfather was in thehabit of going out at night with a young under-keeper, of whom he wasvery fond, to look after the game and see if any poachers, whom heregarded as his natural enemies, were about.[DIALOGUE]"One night, as I suppose, my grandfather had been out with the young manin question, and, returning by the plantations, where the hill issteepest, and not far from the chalk-pit you[Illustration: "_He and the keeper buried the body._"]remarked on yesterday, they came upon a man who, though not actuallybelonging to the country, was well known in it as a sort of travelingtinker of indifferent character and a notorious poacher. Mind this, I am
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][DEATH][PROBLEM][EMOTION]not sure it was at the place I mention; I only now surmise it. On theparticular night in question, my grandfather and the keeper must havecaught this man setting snares; there must have been a tussle, in thecourse of which, as subsequent circumstances have led me to imagine, theman showed fight, and was knocked down by one or the other of thetwo--my grandfather or the keeper. I believe that after having madevarious attempts to restore him, they found that the man was actuallydead."They were both in great alarm and concern--my grandfather especially.
[W BOB HOLLAND][DEATH][PERSPECTIVE][CONFLICT][ACTION][MURDER]He had been prominent in putting down some factory riots, and had givenorders to the military to fire, whereby several lives had been lost.There was a vast outcry against him, and a certain political party haddenounced him as an assassin. No man was more vituperated; yet now, inmy conscience, I believe he acted with both discretion and pluck, andarrested a mischievous movement that might have led to much bloodshed.Be that as it may, my impression is that he lost his head over thisfatal affair with the tinker, and that he and the keeper together buriedthe body secretly, not far from the place where he was killed. I now
[W BOB HOLLAND]think it was in the chalk-pit, and that the skeleton found years afterthere belonged to this man.[DIALOGUE]""Good heavens![DIALOGUE]" I exclaimed, as at once my mind rushed back to thefigure with the fur cap that I had seen against the window.Sir Francis went on: "The sudden disappearance of the tramp, in view ofhis well-known habits and wandering mode of life, did not for some timeexcite surprise; but, later on, one or two circumstances having led tosuspicion, an inquiry was set on foot, and among others, mygrandfather’s keepers were examined before the magistrates. It wasremembered afterwards that the under-keeper in question was absent atthe time of the inquiry, my grandfather having sent him with some dogsto a brother-in-law of his who lived upon the moors; but whether anyonenoticed the fact, or if they did, preferred to be silent, noobservations were made. Nothing came of the investigation, and the whole
[W BOB HOLLAND][EMOTION][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK][CONTEXT][PROBLEM][TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][ACTION]subject would have been dropped if it had not been that two years later,for some reasons I do not understand, but at the instigation of amagistrate recently imported into the division, whom my grandfathergreatly disliked, and who was opposed to him in politics, a freshinquiry was instituted. In the course of that inquiry it transpiredthat, owing to some unguarded words dropped by the under-keeper, awarrant was about to be issued for his arrest. My grandfather, who had afit of the gout, was away from home at the time, but on hearing the newshe came home at once. The evening he returned he had a long interviewwith the young man, who left the house after he had supped in theservants’ hall. It was observed that he looked much depressed. The
[W BOB HOLLAND][METAPHOR][SURPRISE][CONTEXT][DEATH][FLASHBACK][PERSPECTIVE][CHARACTERIZATION][CONFLICT]warrant was issued the next day, but in the meantime the keeper haddisappeared. My grandfather gave orders to his people to do everythingin their power to assist the authorities in the search that was at onceset on foot, but was unable himself to take any share in it."No trace of the keeper was found, although at a subsequent periodrumors circulated that he had been heard of in America. But the manhaving been unmarried, he gradually dropped out of remembrance, and asmy grandfather never allowed the subject to be mentioned in hispresence, I should probably never have known anything about it but forthe vague tradition which always attaches to such events, and for thisfact, that after my grandfather’s death, a letter came addressed to himfrom somewhere in the United States from some one--the name differentfrom that of the keeper--but alluding to the past, and implying thepresence of a common secret, and, of course, with it came a request formoney. I replied, mentioning the death of Sir Richard, and asking for
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][MURDER]an explanation. I did get an answer, and it is from that that I am ableto fill in so much of the story. But I never learned where the man hadbeen killed and buried, and my next letter to the fellow was returnedwith ‘deceased’ written across it. Somehow, it never occurred to me tillI heard your story that possibly the skeleton in the chalk-pit might bethat of the poaching tinker. I will now most assuredly have it buried in
[W BOB HOLLAND][GHOST]the churchyard.[DIALOGUE]""That certainly ought to be done,[DIALOGUE]" said I."And,[DIALOGUE]" said Sir Francis, after a pause, "I give you my word--after theburial of the bones, and you are gone, I will sleep for a week in thebed in the gallery, and report to you if I see or hear anything. If allbe quiet, then--well, you form your own conclusions.[DIALOGUE]"I left a day after. Before long I got a letter from my friend, brief,but to the point: "All quiet, old boy; come again."THE GHOST OF THE COUNT.Not far from the Alameda, in the City of Mexico, there is a great oldstone building, in which once lived a very wealthy and wicked Spanishcount. The house has about four floors, and ninety rooms, more or less.
[W BOB HOLLAND][HAUNTED HOUSE]The entire fourth floor is rented and occupied by a big American firm,and their bookkeeper, an American girl, has given us the following trueaccount of the ghost that for years haunted the building. The secondfloor is unoccupied, as no one cares to live there for obvious reasons.And the bottom floor is also unoccupied, save for lumber rooms, emptyboxes and crates and barrels. And last of all is the great patio withits tiled floor, where secretly in the night a duel was fought to thedeath by the wicked count and a famous Austrian prince, who was one ofMaximilian’s men. The count was killed.
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][DANGER][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][EMOTION]No one knows why the duel was fought; some say it was because of abeautiful Spanish woman; some say that it was because of treasure thatthe two jointly [DIALOGUE]"conveyed," and which the count refused to divide withhis princely [DIALOGUE]"socio," and more people--Mexicans--shrug their shouldersif you ask about it, and say, [DIALOGUE]"Quien sabe?"[DIALOGUE]"I saw a ghost here last night, Miss James," announces our cashier withmuch eclat and evident pride.So great is the shock that I gasp, and my pen drops, spattering red inkon my nice fresh cuffs, and (worse luck!) on the ledger page that I hadjust totted up. It is ruined, and I will have to erase it,or--something! Wretched man!
[W BOB HOLLAND][DIALOGUE]"I wish to goodness it had taken you off," I cry, wrathfully, as I lookat the bespattered work. [DIALOGUE]"Now will you just look here and see what youhave done? I wish you and your ghosts were in----"[DIALOGUE]"Gehenna?" he inquires, sweetly; "I’ll fix that--it won’t take half aminute. And don’t look so stern, else I won’t tell you about the‘espanto.’ And you will be sorry if you don’t hear about it--it would
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][SETTING][PLOT][CHARACTERIZATION]make such a good story.[DIALOGUE]" (Insinuatingly.)"Then go ahead with it.[DIALOGUE]" (Ungraciously.)"Well, last night I was waiting for West. He was to meet me here, after
[W BOB HOLLAND][PROBLEM][SURPRISE]which it was our intention to hit the--that is, I mean we were going outtogether. (I nod scornfully.) And it seems that while I was patientlywaiting here, in my usual sweet-tempered way, the blank idiot had hissupper and then lay down to rest himself for a while. You know howdelicate he is? (Another contemptuous nod.) Unfortunately he forgot the
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][EMOTION][GHOST]engagement, and slept on. He says he never awoke until three o’clock,and so didn’t come, thinking I wouldn’t be there. Meantime I also wentto sleep, and might have snoozed on until three, likewise, but for thefact that the ghost woke me----[DIALOGUE]""Well? Do go on,[DIALOGUE]" I urge."The ghost woke me, as I said,[DIALOGUE]" proceeds the simpleton, slowly. "It waspassing its cold fingers over my face and groaning. Really, it was most
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][EMOTION][FLASHBACK][CONFLICT][GHOST]extraordinary. At first I didn’t know what it was; then, as I felt theicy fingers stroking my face and heard blood-curdling groans issuingfrom the darkness, I knew what it was. And I remembered the story of theprince and his little duel down in the patio, and knew it was the ghostof the prince’s victim. By the way, you don’t know what a funnysensation it is to have a ghost pat your face, Miss James----[DIALOGUE]""Pat nothing,[DIALOGUE]" I retort, indignantly. "I wonder you are not ashamed to
[W BOB HOLLAND][PROBLEM][DANGER][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][PLOT][METAPHOR][DEATH][EXPOSITION][CHARACTERIZATION][MURDER]tell me such fibs. Such a ta-ra-diddle! And as for the man that theprince killed downstairs, you know as well as I do that he was takenhome to Spain and buried there. Why, then, should he come back here,into our offices, and pat your face?"
[W BOB HOLLAND][GHOST][DIALOGUE]"Ah, that I can’t say," with a supercilious drawl. [DIALOGUE]"I can only accountfor it by thinking that the ghost has good taste--better than that ofsome people I know," meaningly. [DIALOGUE]"But honestly, I swear that I am tellingyou the truth--cross my heart and hope to die if I am not! And youdon’t know how brave I was--I never screamed; in fact, I never made asound; oh, I was brave!"[DIALOGUE]"Then what did you do?" sternly."I ran. Por Dios, how I ran! You remember with what alacrity we got down
[W BOB HOLLAND][TRANSITION][DANGER][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK][ACTION][GHOST]the stairs during the November earthquake? (I remember only toodistinctly.) Well, last night’s run wasn’t a run, in comparison--it wasa disappearance, a flight, a sprint! I went down the four flights ofstairs like a streak of blue lightning, and the ghost flew with me. I
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][EMOTION][PERSPECTIVE][FLASHBACK][TRANSITION]heard the pattering of its steps and its groans clean down to the patiodoor, and I assure you I quite thought I had made such an impressionthat it was actually going on home with me. And the thought made me feelso weak that I felt perforce obliged to take a--have a--that is,strengthen myself with a cocktail. After which I felt stronger and wenthome quite peacefully. But it was an uncanny experience, wasn’t it?"
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][EMOTION][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][DIALOGUE]"Was it before or after taking that cocktail?" I ask, incredulously.[DIALOGUE]"And did you take one only or eleven?"I am hard on the man, but he really deserves it. Ghosts! Spirits,perhaps, but not ghosts. Whereat his feelings are quite [DIALOGUE]"hurted"--somuch so that he vows he will never tell me anything again; I had betterread about Doubting Thomas; he never has seen such an unbelieving womanin all his life, and if I were only a man he would be tempted to praythat I might see the ghost; it would serve me right. Then, wrathfully
[W BOB HOLLAND][PROBLEM][ACTION][TRANSITION][CONFLICT]departs, to notice me no more that day.Not believing the least bit in ghosts I gave the matter no more thought.In fact, when you fall heir to a set of books that haven’t been postedfor nineteen days, and you have to do it all, and get up your trialbalance, too, or else give up your Christmas holidays, you haven’t muchtime to think about ghosts, or anything else, except entries. And thoughI had been working fourteen hours per day, the 24th of December, noonhour, found me with a difference of $13.89. The which I, of course, must
[W BOB HOLLAND][TRANSITION]locate and straighten out before departing next morning on my week’sholiday. Por supuesto, it meant night work. Nothing else would do; andbesides, our plans had all been made to leave on the eight o’clock trainnext morning. So I would just sit up all night, if need be, and find thewretched balance and be done with it.
[W BOB HOLLAND][ACTION][DANGER][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][HORROR]Behold me settled for work that night at seven o’clock in my own office,with three lamps burning to keep it from looking dismal and lonely, andbooks and ledgers and journals piled up two feet high around me. If hardwork would locate that nasty, hateful $13.89 it would surely be found. Ihad told the portero downstairs on the ground floor to try and keepawake for a time, but if I didn’t soon finish the work I would come downand call him when I was ready to go home.
[W BOB HOLLAND][DANGER][PROBLEM]He lived in a little room, all shut off from the rest of the building,so that it was rather difficult to get at him. Besides, he was the verylaziest and sleepiest peon possible, and though he was supposed to takecare of the big building at night, patrolling it so as to keep offladrones, he in reality slept so soundly that the last trumpet, muchless Mexican robbers, would not have roused him.And for this very reason, before settling to my work I was careful to goaround and look to locks and bolts myself; everything was secure, andthe doors safely fastened. So that if ladrones did break through theywould have to be in shape to pass through keyholes or possess falsekeys.
[W BOB HOLLAND]With never a thought of spirits or porteros, or anything else, beyondthe thirteen dollars and eighty-nine cents, I worked and added andre-added and footed up. And at eleven o’clock, grazia a Dios, I had thethirteen dollars all safe, and would have whooped for joy, had I thetime. However, I wasn’t out of the woods yet, the sum of eighty-ninedollars being often more easy of location than eighty-nine cents. Thelatter must be found, also, before I could have the pleasure of shoutingin celebration thereof.
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][RELIEF][PROBLEM][HORROR]At it I went again. After brain cudgeling and more adding and prayerfulthought I at last had under my thumb that abominable eighty cents.Eureka! Only nine cents out. I could get it all straight and have some
[W BOB HOLLAND][EMOTION][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][FLASHBACK][METAPHOR]sleep, after all! Inspired by which thought I smothered my yawns andagain began to add. I looked at my watch--ten minutes to twelve. PerhapsI could get it fixed before one.
[W BOB HOLLAND][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][DANGER]I suppose I had worked at the nine cents for about twenty minutes. Oneof the cash entries looked to me to be in error. I compared it with thevoucher--yes, that was just where the trouble lay! Elevencents--ten--nine----S-t-t! Out went the lights in the twinkling of an eye--as I sat, gaping
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][EMOTION][DANGER][CONFLICT][CONTEXT][EXPOSITION][PROBLEM][PERSPECTIVE][SETTING][CHARACTERIZATION][WEAPON][CHARACTER][PLOT][TRANSITION][FLASHBACK][METAPHOR][DEATH][CLIMAX][ACTION][SUSPENSE][RESOLUTION][HORROR]in my astonishment, from out of the pitchy darkness of the room came themost dreary, horrible, blood-curdling groan imaginable. As I satparalyzed, not daring to breathe, doubting my senses for a moment, andthen thinking indignantly that it was some trick of that wretchedcashier, I felt long, thin, icy fingers passing gently over my face.Malgame Dios! what a sensation! At first I was afraid to move. Then I
[W BOB HOLLAND][EMOTION][DANGER][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][PROBLEM][FLASHBACK][HORROR]nervously tried to brush the icy, bony things away. As fast as Ibrushed, with my heart beating like a steam-hammer, and gasping withdeadly fear, the fingers would come back again; a cold wind was blowingover me. Again came that dreadful groan, and too frightened to move orscream, I tumbled in a heap on the floor, among the books and ledgers.Then I suppose I fainted.
[W BOB HOLLAND][EMOTION][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][DANGER][PROBLEM][PERSPECTIVE]When I regained my senses I was still in a heap with the ledgers; stillit was dark and still I felt the cold fingers caressing my face. Atwhich I became thoroughly desperate. No ghost should own me! I hadlaughed at the poor cashier and hinted darkly at cocktails. Pray, what
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][MURDER]better was I?I scrambled to my feet, the fingers still stroking my face. I mustaddress them--what language--did they understand English or Spanish, Iwondered? Spanish would doubtless be most suitable, if indeed, it wasthe ghost of the murdered count----.
[W BOB HOLLAND][DIALOGUE]"Will you do me the favor, Senor Ghost," I started out bravely, in mybest Spanish, but with a very trembling voice, [DIALOGUE]"to inform me what it isthat you desire? Is there anything I can do for you? Because, if not, Iwould like very much to be allowed to finish my work, which I cannot do(if you will pardon my abruptness) if I am not alone."(Being the ghost of a gentleman and a diplomat, surely he would take thehint and vanish. Ojala!)Perhaps the ghost did not understand my Spanish; at any rate there wasno articulate reply; there was another groan--again the fingers touchedme, and then there was such a mournful sigh that I felt sorry for thepoor thing--what could be the matter with it? With my pity, all fear waslost for a moment, and I said to the darkness all about me:"What is it that you wish, pobre senor? Can I not aid you? I am not
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][EMOTION][DANGER][TRANSITION][PROBLEM][CONFLICT]afraid--let me help you!"The fingers moved uncertainly for a moment; then the ledgers all felldown, with a loud bang; a cold hand caught mine, very gently--I triednot to feel frightened, but it was difficult--and I was led off blindly,through the offices. I could not see a thing--not a glimmer of lightshowed; not a sound was heard except my own footsteps, and the faintsound of the invisible something that was leading me along--there wereno more groans, thank goodness, else I should have shrieked and fainted,without a doubt. Only the pattering footsteps and the cold hand that ledme on and on.
[W BOB HOLLAND]We--the fingers and I--were somehow in the great hall, then on thesecond floor, and at last on the stairs, going on down, flight afterflight. Then I knew that I was being led about by the fingers on thetiled floor of the patio, and close to the portero’s lodge. Simpletonthat he was! Sleeping like a log, no doubt, while I was being led aboutin the black darkness by an invisible hand, and no one to save me! I
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][DANGER][CONFLICT][EMOTION][TRANSITION][HORROR]would have yelled, of course, but for one fact--I found it utterlyimpossible to speak or move my tongue, being a rare and uncomfortablesensation.But where were we going? Back into the unused lumber rooms, joining ontothe patio? Nothing there, except barrels and slabs and empty boxes. What
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][GHOST]could the ghost mean? He must be utterly demented, surely.In the middle of the first room we paused. I had an idea of rushing outand screaming for the portero, but abandoned it when I found that myfeet wouldn’t go. I heard steps passing to and fro about the floor, and
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][SETTING][GHOST]waited, cold and trembling. They approached me; again my hand was taken,and I was led over near the corner of the room. Obedient to the unseenwill, I bent down and groped about the floor, guided by the cold fingersholding mine, until I felt something like a tiny ring, set firmly in thefloor. I pulled at it faintly, but it did not move, at which the ghostgave a faint sigh. For a second the cold fingers pressed mine, quite
[W BOB HOLLAND]affectionately, then released me, and I heard steps passing slowly intothe patio, then dying away. Where was it going, and what on earth did itall mean?But I was so tired and wrought up I tried to find the door, but couldn’t(the cashier would have been revenged could he have seen me stupidlyfumbling at a barrel, thinking it was the door), and at last, toofatigued and sleepy to stand, I dropped down on the cold stone floorand went to sleep.I must have slept for some hours, for when I awoke the light of dawn wascoming in at the window, and I sat up and wondered if I had taken leaveof my senses during the night. What on earth could I be doing here in
[W BOB HOLLAND][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][EMOTION][ACTION]the lumber-room? Then, like a flash, I remembered, and, halfunconsciously, crept about on the floor seeking the small ring. There itwas! I caught it and jerked at it hard. Hey, presto, change! For it
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][FLASHBACK]seemed to me that the entire floor was giving way. There was a sliding,crashing sound, and I found myself hanging on for dear life to a barrelthat, fortunately, retained its equilibrium, and with my feet danglinginto space. Down below me was a small, stone-floored room, with bigboxes and small ones ranged about the walls. Treasure! Like a flash the
[W BOB HOLLAND][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][DANGER][CONFLICT][HELL]thought struck me, and with one leap I was down in the secret roomgazing about at the boxes.But, alas! upon investigation, the biggest chests proved empty. The bad,wicked count! No wonder he couldn’t rest in his Spanish grave, but must
[W BOB HOLLAND]come back to the scene of his wickedness and deceit to make reparation!But the smaller chests were literally crammed with all sorts ofthings--big heavy Spanish coins, in gold and silver--gold and silverdinner services, with the crest of the unfortunate emperor; magnificentpieces of jeweled armor and weapons, beautiful jewelry and looseprecious stones. I deliberately selected handfuls of the latter, givingmy preference to the diamonds and pearls--I had always had a taste forthem, which I had never before been able to gratify!--and packed them ina wooden box that I found in the lumber-room. The gold and dinner
[W BOB HOLLAND][GHOST]services and armor, etc., I left as they were, being rather cumbersome,and carried off, rejoicing, my big box of diamonds and pearls and otherjewelry.Needless to say we didn’t go away for the holidays on the eight o’clocktrain. But I did come down to the office and proceeded to locate mymissing nine cents. After which I unfolded the tale of the ghost and the
[W BOB HOLLAND][EMOTION][RELIEF][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][GHOST]treasure--only keeping quiet the matter of my private loot. Of which Iwas heartily glad afterwards. For when the government learned of thefind what do you suppose they offered me for going about with the ghostand discovering the secret room and treasure? Ten thousand dollars! When
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][PROBLEM]I refused, stating that I would take merely, as my reward, one of thegold dinner services, the greedy things objected at first, but I finallyhad my way. And to this very day they have no idea that I--even I--haveall the beautiful jewels. Wouldn’t they be furious if they knew it? Butthey aren’t apt to, unless they learn English and read this story. Which
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONTEXT][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE]isn’t likely.THE OLD MANSION.Down on Long Beach, that narrow strip of sand which stretches along theNew Jersey coast from Barnegat Inlet on the north to Little Egg HarborInlet on the south, the summer sojourner at some one of the numerousresorts, which of late years have sprung up every few miles, may, inwandering over the sand dunes just across the bay from the village ofManahawkin, stumble over some charred timbers or vestiges of crumblingchimneys, showing that once, years back, a human habitation has stoodthere. If the find rouses the jaded curiosity of the visitorsufficiently to impel him to question the weatherbeaten old bayman whosails him on his fishing trips he will learn that these relics mark thesite of one of the first summer hotels erected on the New Jersey coast.
[W BOB HOLLAND][CHARACTER][RELIEF][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][CONTEXT][CHARACTERIZATION][METAPHOR][DIALOGUE]"That’s where the Old Mansion stood," he will be informed by CaptainNate or Captain Sam, or whatever particular captain it may chance to be,and if by good fortune it chances to be Captain Jim, he will hear astory that will pleasantly pass away the long wait for a sheepsheadbite.It was my good luck to have secured Captain Jim for a preceptor in theangler’s art during my vacation last summer, and his stories andreminiscences of Long Beach were not the least enjoyable features of thetwo weeks’ sojourn.Captain Jim was not garrulous. Few of the baymen are. They are a sturdy,
[W BOB HOLLAND][TRANSITION][CONTEXT][CONFLICT][FLASHBACK][PERSPECTIVE]self-reliant and self-controlled people, full of strong common sense,but still with that firm belief in the supernatural which seems inherentin dwellers by the sea.[DIALOGUE]"The Old Mansion," said Captain Jim, "or the Mansion of Health, for thatwas its full name, was built away back in 1822, so I’ve heard my fathersay. There had been a tavern close by years before that was kept by aman named Cranmer, and people used to come from Philadelphia by stage,sixty miles through the pines, to ‘Hawkin, and then cross here by boat.Some would stop at Cranmer’s and others went on down the beach toHomer’s which was clear down at End by the Inlet. Finally some of thewealthy people concluded that they wanted better accommodations thanCranmer gave, so they formed the Great Swamp Long Beach Company, andbuilt the Mansion of Health. I’ve heard that when it was built it was
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][METAPHOR]the biggest hotel on the coast, and was considered a wonder. It was 120feet long, three stories high, and had a porch running all the wayaround it, with a balcony on top. It was certainly a big thing forthose days. I’ve heard father tell many a time of the stage loads of gaypeople that used to come rattling into ‘Hawkin, each stage drawn by fourhorses, and sometimes four or five of them a day in the summer. A good
[W BOB HOLLAND][TRANSITION]many people, too, used to come in their own carriages, and leave themover on the mainland until they were ready to go home. There were gaytimes at the Old Mansion then, and it made times good for the peoplealong shore, too.[DIALOGUE]""How long did the Old Mansion flourish, Captain?[DIALOGUE]" I asked."Well, for twenty-five or thirty years people came there summer aftersummer. Then they built a railroad to Cape May, and that, with the
[W BOB HOLLAND]ghosts, settled the Mansion of Health.[DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE]""What do you mean by the ghosts?[DIALOGUE]" I demanded."Well, you see,[DIALOGUE]" said Captain Jim, cutting off a mouthful of navy plug,"the story got around that the old house was haunted. Some people saidthere were queer things seen there, and strange noises were heard thatnobody could account for, and pretty soon the place got a bad name andvisitors were so few that it didn’t pay to keep it open any more.""But how did it get the name of being haunted, Captain Jim?[DIALOGUE]" Ipersisted."Why, it was this way,[DIALOGUE]" continued the mariner. "Maybe you’ve heard ofthe time early in the fifties when the Powhatan was wrecked on the beachhere, and every soul on board was lost. She was an emigrant ship, andthere were over 400 people aboard--passengers and crew. She came ashore
[W BOB HOLLAND][DEATH]here during the equinoctial storm in September. There wasn’t anylife-saving stations in them days, and everyone was drowned. You can seethe long graves now over in the ‘Hawkin churchyard, where the bodieswere buried after they came ashore. They put them in three long trenchesthat were dug from one end of the burying-ground to the other. The only
[W BOB HOLLAND][FLASHBACK]people on the beach that night was the man who took care of the oldmansion. He lived there with his family, and his son-in-law lived withhim. He was the wreckmaster for this part of the coast, too. It wasn’ttill the second day that the people from ‘Hawkin could get over to thebeach, and by that time the bodies had all come ashore, and thewreckmaster had them all piled up on the sand. I was a youngster, then,
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][HORROR]and came over with my father, and, I tell you, it was the awfullestsight I ever saw--them long rows of drowned people, all lying there withtheir white, still faces turned up to the sky. Some were women, withtheir dead babies clasped tight in their arms, and some were husbandsand wives, whose bodies came ashore locked together in a death embrace.I’ll never forget that sight as long as I live. Well, when the coronercame and took charge he began to inquire whether any money or valuableshad been found, but the wreckmaster declared that not a solitary coinhad been washed ashore. People thought this was rather singular, as the
[W BOB HOLLAND]emigrants were, most of them, well-to-do Germans, and were known to havebrought a good deal of money with them, but it was concluded that it hadgone down with the ship. Well, the poor emigrants were given pauperburial, and the people had begun to forget their suspicions until threeor four months later there came another storm, and the sea broke clearover the beach, just below the Old Mansion, and washed away the sand.Next morning early two men from ‘Hawkin sailed across the bay and landedon the beach. They walked across on the hard bottom where the sea hadwashed across, and, when about half way from the bay, one of the men sawsomething curious close up against the stump of an old cedar tree. He
[W BOB HOLLAND]called the other man’s attention to it, and they went over to the stump.What they found was a pile of leather money-belts that would have filleda wheelbarrow. Every one was cut open and empty. They had been buried inthe sand close by the old stump, and the sea had washed away thecovering. The men didn’t go any further.
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][MURDER]"They carried the belts to their boats and sailed back to ‘Hawkin asfast as the wind would take them. Of course, it made a big sensation,and everybody was satisfied that the wreckmaster had robbed the bodies,if he hadn’t done anything worse, but there was no way to prove it, andso nothing was done. The wreckmaster didn’t stay around here long afterthat, though. The people made it too hot for him, and he and his familywent away South, where it was said he bought a big plantation and a lotof slaves. Years afterward the story came to ‘Hawkin somehow that he was
[W BOB HOLLAND][EMOTION][SURPRISE][GHOST]killed in a barroom brawl, and that his son-in-law was drowned by hisboat upsettin’ while he was out fishin’. I don’t furnish any affidavitswith that part of the story, though.[DIALOGUE]"However, after that nobody lived in the Old Mansion for long at a time.People would go there, stay a week or two, and leave--and at last it wasgiven up entirely to beach parties in the day time, and ghosts atnight."[DIALOGUE]"But, Captain, you don’t really believe the ghost part, do you?" Iasked.Captain Jim looked down the bay, expectorated gravely over the side ofthe boat, and answered, slowly:[DIALOGUE]"Well, I don’t know as I would have believed in ’em if I hadn’t seen theghost."[DIALOGUE]"What!" I exclaimed; "you saw it? Tell me about it. I’ve always wanted
[W BOB HOLLAND][METAPHOR][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE][CHARACTERIZATION][CHARACTER]to see a ghost, or next best thing, a man who has seen one.[DIALOGUE]""It was one August, about 1861,[DIALOGUE]" said the captain. "I was a youngfeller then, and with a half dozen more was over on the beach cuttingsalt hay. We didn’t go home at nights, but did our own cooking in theOld Mansion kitchen, and at nights slept on piles of hay upstairs. We
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT]were a reckless lot of scamps, and reckoned that no ghosts could scareus. There was a big full moon that night, and it was as light as day.The muskeeters was pretty bad, too, and it was easier to stay awake thango to sleep. Along toward midnight me and two other fellers went out onthe old balcony, and began to race around the house. We hollered and
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][EMOTION]yelled, and chased each other for half an hour or so, and then weconcluded we had better go to sleep, so we started for the window of theroom where the rest were. This window was near one end on the oceanside, and as I came around the corner I stopped as if I had been shot,and my hair raised straight up on top of my head. Right there in frontof that window stood a woman looking out over the sea, and in her armsshe held a little child. I saw her as plain as I see you now. It seemed
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][TRANSITION]to me like an hour she stood there, but I don’t suppose it was a second;then she was gone. When I could move I looked around for the other boys,and they were standing there paralyzed. They had seen the woman, too. Wedidn’t say much, and we didn’t sleep much that night, and the next nightwe bunked out on the beach. The rest of the crowd made all manner of
[W BOB HOLLAND][FLASHBACK][HAUNTED HOUSE]fun of us, but we had had all the ghost we wanted, and I never set footinside the old house after that.[DIALOGUE]""When did it burn down, Captain?[DIALOGUE]" I asked, as Jim relapsed into silence."Somewhere about twenty-five years ago. A beach party had been roastingclams in the old oven, and in some way the fire got to the woodwork. It
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][PROBLEM][DANGER][GHOST]was as dry as tinder, and I hope the ghosts were all burnt up with it.[DIALOGUE]"A MISFIT GHOST.Every boy with a knowledge of adventurous literature, otherwise "novelsof action,[DIALOGUE]" knows of the "phantom ship," the spook of the high seas.But it has not been known that ships themselves are haunted, and that inthe service of the United States Coast Survey there is a vessel now incommission that is by her own officers supposed to be haunted.
[W BOB HOLLAND][PROBLEM]Yet the Eagre, a 140-foot schooner of the coast survey, is looked uponin the service as a very undesirable vessel to be aboard of. About herthere is an atmosphere of gloom that wardroom jest cannot dispel.Duty on board her has been shunned as would be a pestilence, and storieshave been told by officers who have cruised aboard her that are not goodfor timid people to hear. Officers have hesitated about telling theseuncanny stories, but they have become sufficiently well known to make abillet to duty aboard the Eagre unwelcome among the coast survey men.
[W BOB HOLLAND]The Mohawk was launched June 10, 1875, at Greenpoint, and she was thenthe largest sailing yacht afloat.William T. Garner, her young millionaire owner, was very proud of hisnew craft, and all the then leaders of New York society were invited toparticipate in the good time afloat with which her launching wascelebrated. Commodore Garner, then but thirty-three years old, and hisyoung wife entertained charmingly, and the trim, speedy Mohawk waschristened with unusually merry festivities. Soon after that she was
[W BOB HOLLAND][ACTION][DEATH][DANGER][PROBLEM][METAPHOR][SURPRISE][MURDER]capsized by a sudden squall off the landing at Stapleton, N. Y., and sixpeople were drowned like rats in her cabin and forecastle.Then the Mohawk was raised at a cost of $25,000 and purchased by theUnited States Government for the service of the coast survey. Her name
[W BOB HOLLAND][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK][PERSPECTIVE][CONTEXT][CHARACTERIZATION]was changed to Eagre, for Jack Tar is proverbially superstitious, andwith the old name it would have been impossible to ship a crew.Lieutenant Higby King describes his initial experience when he wasassigned to duty on the Eagre in this way:[DIALOGUE]"She had her full complement of officers minus one when I boarded her atNewport to complete the list. Every cabin was occupied but the portcabin by the companion way, and to that I was assigned."We had a jolly wardroom mess that night, and I retired from it early,as I was tired by my journey to join the vessel. The others who werestill at the table regarded my retirement to the port cabin in absolutesilence, having bidden me good-night. Their silence did not lead me tosuspect anything, though I knew that the Eagre had once been the Mohawk.
[W BOB HOLLAND][TRANSITION][SURPRISE]My cabin door had the usual cabin lock of brass, and the porthole wasalso securely fastened. There could have been no one under the bed orsofa, as beneath each was a facing of solid oak paneling."I undressed lazily and left the light burning dimly in my bracket lamp.I tried conscientiously to go to sleep for I don’t know how long with myback turned to the light. The noise ceased in the wardroom after a time,
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][GHOST]and I knew the others had turned in, but I felt unaccountably nervousand restless. I turned over and faced the light, thoroughly wide awake,and there in the single chair sat an elderly man, seemingly wrapt indeep thought. He was dressed in a blue yachting reefer, and had a long,gray beard. His hands were clasped in his lap, and his eyes weredowncast. His face was not pale and ghastly, as the faces of ghosts are
[W BOB HOLLAND][METAPHOR][SURPRISE][GHOST]popularly supposed to be, but ruddy and weatherbeaten."I regarded him in scared silence for I don’t know how long, though itseemed an hour when he, or it, or whatever it was, disappeared. Duringthat time the ghost, and such I now believe it to have been, made not amotion, nor did it say anything. Presently I looked again, and it wasgone.
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][HORROR]"At breakfast the others watched me critically as I took my seat. I hadnot intended to say anything about my experience, for I thought then Ihad seen some sort of hallucination and strongly suspected that I wasverging on insanity. Lieutenant Irving asked me if I had slept well. Ireplied that I had. ‘Didn’t you see anything?’ he inquired. I then
[W BOB HOLLAND]frankly admitted that I had and described my experience. Then I learnedthat each one of the seven others present had tried the port cabin atone time or another, and each had seen the self-same apparition. It hadacted in exactly the same way in each case, except in the case ofIrving, who shot at it with his pistol, when it immediately disappeared.Some of the others had been led by their curiosity to inquire if anyonelost on the Mohawk resembled the figure, and found that none of theunfortunate ones at all fitted the description. It had been dubbed by
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONTEXT][HAUNTED HOUSE]them the ‘misfit ghost.’ That one experience was enough for me, andafter that I, by courtesy, shared the cabin of another fellow.[DIALOGUE]"Lieutenant Irving and others corroborate the story of Lieutenant King,and as additional evidence that the Eagre is haunted, Lieutenant Irvingdescribes a New Year’s eve experience of the Eagre’s officers, that is,to say the least, novel in the way of supernatural manifestations."It was at mess. The first toast, ‘Sweethearts and Wives,’ had beendrunk, as it always is by Yankee sailors the world over on occasions offestivity. Everyone was feeling happy, or, as Thackeray has it,‘pleasant,’ when suddenly the sliding-doors separating the wardroom fromthe companion way closed slowly with a loud, squeaking noise. They had
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][ACTION][EMOTION][GHOST]seldom been closed, and it took the entire strength of a man to startthem from their rusty fastenings. Yet upon this occasion they startedeasily and closed tightly, while the officers jumped to their feet inbreathless astonishment. Half a dozen men hauled them open in haste, butnot a soul was behind them or anywhere about. ‘It must be our old friendof the port cabin,’ suggested one, and in awe-stricken silence thehealth of the ‘misfit ghost’ was drunk."
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][GHOST]AN UNBIDDEN GUEST.My cousins, Kate and Tom Howard, married at Trinity, at Easter time,concluded to commence housekeeping by taking one of those delightfullyexpensively furnished, unfurnished cottages, with which the fashionablewatering place of W---- abounds, from whose rear windows one mightalmost take a plunge into the surf, the beach beginning at the backdoor. They went down quite early in May, being in a great hurry to trytheir domestic experiment; and, as the evenings were still cold, theyspent them about the open fire, [DIALOGUE]"spooning."It was upon one of those nights, about eleven o’clock, that they werestartled by a noise, as of some small object falling, soon followed bythe sound of heavy footsteps, and then quiet again reigned supreme. Atonce Tom, poker in hand, boldly started in search of the burglar,followed by Kate, wildly clutching at his coat-tail, and in a state oftremor. They looked upstairs, under the various beds, Kate suggesting
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE]that in novels they were always to be found there.The dining-room was next explored, where all seemed well, and, lastlythe kitchen, where they found what was evidently a solution of themystery. The burglar had entered by the back door, which was found to beunlocked and slightly ajar. The first excitement subsiding, theyreturned again to the dining-room, where Tom, upon closer inspection,then discovered that one of a pair of quaint little pepper-pots, weddinggifts, was missing, and other small articles on the sideboard had beenslightly disturbed.
[W BOB HOLLAND]The next morning, when Kate mildly remonstrated with the queen of thekitchen for her carelessness, she received a shock by being told that itwas her usual custom to leave the door open, [DIALOGUE]"so that it would be aisy,convanient loike for the milkmaid." They parted with her, and a new maidwas engaged, whose chief qualification for the place was that she wasmost faithful in the discharge of her duties, especially in [DIALOGUE]"lockingup."While they mourned the loss of the pepper-pot, still it seemed sotrifling when they thought of that lovely repousse salad bowl, sent byAunt Julia, which stood near by, that nothing was said of the lossoutside of the family, and the little household settled into its normalstate once more of [DIALOGUE]"billing and cooing."About a fortnight later, Tom started out one night with an oldfisherman, one of the natives, and a local [DIALOGUE]"character," to indulge inthat delightful pastime, so dear to the heart of man, known as[DIALOGUE]"eeling," and, as the night was dark, the eels were particularly[DIALOGUE]"sporty," so that it was well on towards the [DIALOGUE]"wee sma’ hours" when Tomat last returned to the cottage.He found all excitement within. Kate was in hysterics, and the new maid,also weeping, was industriously applying the camphor bottle to hermistress’ nose. The burglar, or ghost, as they had now decided, thewindows and doors being found to be securely locked this time, had beenabroad again, but had succeeded in purloining nothing. His royal
[W BOB HOLLAND]ghostship had amused himself, apparently, by simply walking about.[DIALOGUE]"Oh, Tom! he had on such heavy boots and was so dreadfully bold aboutit," said Kate, tearfully.From that time Kate became nervous and refused to be left alone. Tomstarted whenever a door creaked, and the [DIALOGUE]"treasure" departed hurriedly,saying, [DIALOGUE]"Faith, the house is haunted, sure."After that Kate spent her days in [DIALOGUE]"girl hunting," and her nights inanswering shadowy advertisements that never materialized. They triedIrish, English, Dutch, and a [DIALOGUE]"heathen Chinee," with a sprinkling of[DIALOGUE]"colored ladies" to vary the monotony. They seemed about to become
[W BOB HOLLAND][TRANSITION][METAPHOR][EMOTION][WITCH]famous throughout the length and breadth of the land as [DIALOGUE]"the familythat changes help once a week," when they landed Treasure No. 2.Shortly after her advent we were all asked down to W----, to helpcelebrate their happiness, and incidentally to christen the new dinnerset. We were not a little surprised at finding Kate so pale and Tomrather distrait. However, after a delightful dinner, that should have
[W BOB HOLLAND][CLIMAX][SURPRISE][GHOST]filled with pleasure the most exacting bride, we adjourned to thepiazza, leaving the men to the contemplation of their cigars. We wereenthusiastic in our praise of the house, and congratulated Kate insecuring such a prize, when, to our horror, she burst into tears, andsaid: [DIALOGUE]"Oh, girls, it’s a dreadful place; it’s haunted!" and thentearfully proceeded with the details, until we all felt creepy andsuggested the parlor and lights.It was not until long afterwards that Kate discovered that Tom had alsorelated the [DIALOGUE]"ghost story" to the men, that evening, to which Ned Harrishad said, laconically, [DIALOGUE]"Rats," and Bob Shaw laughingly remarked, [DIALOGUE]"Tom,old chap, you really shouldn’t take your nightcap so strong."About the first of July the climax came. The ghost walked again, thistime taking not only the remaining pepper-pot, but also a silversalt-cellar. Evidently he had a penchant for small articles, but unlike
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][FLASHBACK][METAPHOR]former times, everything on the sideboard was in the greatest disorder.Aunt Julia’s salad bowl was found on the floor, and not far away thecheese-dish, with its contents scattered about. This time one of thewindows was found half open. A week later a note came to me from Kate,saying that she and Tom had gone to Saratoga to spend the remainder ofthe season with her mother.
[W BOB HOLLAND]The following spring Tom received a note and parcel from Mr. B----, theowner of the house at W----, which read as follows:     DEAR MR. HOWARD: I send you by express three articles of silver,     which my wife suggests may belong to you, as they are marked with     your initials, namely, two silver pepper-pots and a salt-cellar;     they were found, the other day, during the process of spring house     cleaning, in a rat hole, behind the sideboard. I forgot to have the     holes stopped up last spring, or to caution you against the water     rats; the great fellows will get in, you know. Kind regards to Mrs.     Howard.Very truly,JOHN B----.
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][PROBLEM][DANGER][DEATH][CONFLICT][GHOST]The next season the [DIALOGUE]"Ghost Club" was organized, the badge being a smallsilver rat, bearing proudly aloft a tiny pepper-pot. We thoughtfullyoffered Tom the presidency, but he declined, with offended dignity, fromthe effects of which I think he will never fully recover.THE DEAD WOMAN’S PHOTOGRAPH.Virgil Hoyt is a photographer’s assistant up at St. Paul, and a man of a
[W BOB HOLLAND][CHARACTER][CHARACTERIZATION][PERSPECTIVE][TRANSITION][METAPHOR][ACTION][CONTEXT][SURPRISE]good deal of taste. He has been in search of the picturesque all overthe West, and hundreds of miles to the north in Canada, and can speakthree or four Indian dialects, and put a canoe through the rapids. Thatis to say, he is a man of an adventurous sort and no dreamer. He canfight well and shoot well and swim well enough to put up a winning racewith the Indian boys, and he can sit all day in the saddle and not dreamabout it at night.
[W BOB HOLLAND][PROBLEM][EMOTION][PERSPECTIVE][CONFLICT][DANGER][METAPHOR][SURPRISE]Wherever he goes he uses his camera.[DIALOGUE]"The world," Hoyt is in the habit of saying to those who sit with himwhen he smokes his pipe, [DIALOGUE]"was created in six days to be photographed.Man--and especially woman--was made for the same purpose. Clouds are notmade to give moisture, nor trees to cast shade. They were created forthe photographer."In short, Virgil Hoyt’s view of the world is whimsical, and he doesn’tlike to be bothered with anything disagreeable. That is the reason thathe loathes and detests going to a house of mourning to photograph acorpse. The horribly bad taste of it offends him partly, and partly heis annoyed at having to shoulder, even for a few moments, a part ofsomeone’s burden of sorrow. He doesn’t like sorrow, and would willinglycanoe 500 miles up the cold Canadian rivers to get rid of it.
[W BOB HOLLAND][DEATH][ACTION][DANGER][CONFLICT]Nevertheless, as assistant photographer, it is often his duty to do thisvery kind of thing.Not long ago he was sent for by a rich Jewish family at St. Paul tophotograph the mother, who had just died. He was very much put out, buthe went. He was taken to the front parlor, where the dead woman lay in
[W BOB HOLLAND]her coffin. It was evident that there was some excitement in thehousehold and that a discussion was going on, but Hoyt wasn’t concerned,and so he paid no attention to the matter.The daughter wanted the coffin turned on end, in order that the corpsemight face the camera properly, but Hoyt said he could overcome therecumbent attitude and make it appear that the face was taken in theposition it would naturally hold in life, and so they went out and lefthim alone with the dead.The face was a strong and positive one, such as may often be seen amongJewish matrons. Hoyt regarded it with some admiration, thinking to
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][FLASHBACK][CHARACTER][CHARACTERIZATION][PROBLEM]himself that she was a woman who had been used to having her own way.There was a strand of hair out of place, and he pushed it back from herbrow. A bud lifted its head too high from among the roses on her breastand spoiled the contour of the chin, so he broke it off. He rememberedthese things later very distinctly and that his hand touched her bareface two or three times.
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE]Then he took the photographs and left the house.He was very busy at the time and several days elapsed before he was ableto develop the plates. He took them from the bath, in which they hadlain with a number of others, and went to work upon them. There werethree plates, he having taken that number merely as a precaution againstany accident. They came up well, but as they developed he became aware
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][PROBLEM]of the existence of something in the photograph which had not beenapparent to his eye. The mysterious always came under the head of thedisagreeable with him, and was therefore to be banished, so he made onlya few prints and put the things away out of sight. He hoped thatsomething would intervene to save him from attempting an explanation.But it is a part of the general perplexity of life that things do notintervene as they ought and when they ought, so one day his employerasked him what had become of those photographs. He
[W BOB HOLLAND][EMOTION][Illustration: [DIALOGUE]"_They left him alone with the dead._"]tried to evade him, but it was futile, and he got out the finishedphotographs and showed them to him. The older man sat staring at them along time.[DIALOGUE]"Hoyt," said he, at length, [DIALOGUE]"you’re a young man, and I suppose you havenever seen anything like this before. But I have. Not exactly the samething, but similar phenomena have come my way a number of times since Iwent into the business, and I want to tell you there are things inheaven and earth not dreamt of----"[DIALOGUE]"Oh, I know all that tommy-rot," cried Hoyt, angrily, [DIALOGUE]"but when anythinghappens I want to know the reason why, and how it is done."[DIALOGUE]"All right," said his employer, [DIALOGUE]"then you might explain why and how thesun rises."But he humored the younger man sufficiently to examine with him the bathin which the plates were submerged and the plates themselves. All was as
[W BOB HOLLAND][PROBLEM][CONFLICT]it should be. But the mystery was there and could not be done away with.Hoyt hoped against hope that the friends of the dead woman would somehowforget about the photographs, but of course the wish was unreasonable,and one day the daughter appeared and asked to see the photographs ofher mother.[DIALOGUE]"Well, to tell the truth," stammered Hoyt, [DIALOGUE]"those didn’t come out aswell as we could wish."[DIALOGUE]"But let me see them," persisted the lady. [DIALOGUE]"I’d like to look at them,anyway."[Illustration: [DIALOGUE]"_He showed her the prints._"]
[W BOB HOLLAND][DIALOGUE]"Well, now," said Hoyt, trying to be soothing, as he believed it wasalways best to be with women--to tell the truth, he was an ignoramuswhere women were concerned--[DIALOGUE]"I think it would be better if you didn’tsee them. There are reasons why----" he ambled on like this, stupid manthat he was, and of course the Jewess said she would see those pictureswithout any further delay.So poor Hoyt brought them out and placed them in her hand, and then ranfor the water pitcher, and had to be at the bother of bathing herforehead to keep her from fainting.For what the lady saw was this: Over face and flowers and the head ofthe coffin fell a thick veil, the edges of which touched the floor insome places. It covered the features so well that not a hint of them was
[W BOB HOLLAND]visible.[DIALOGUE]"There was nothing over mother’s face," cried the lady at length.[DIALOGUE]"Not a thing," acquiesced Hoyt. [DIALOGUE]"I know, because I had occasion to touchher face just before I took the picture. I put some of her hair backfrom her brow."[DIALOGUE]"What does it mean, then?" asked the lady."You know better than I. There is no explanation in science. Perhaps
[W BOB HOLLAND]there is some in psychology.[DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE]""Well,[DIALOGUE]" said the lady, stammering a little and coloring, "mother was agood woman, but she always wanted her own way, and she always had it,too.""Yes?""And she never would have her picture taken. She didn’t admire herself.She said no one should ever see a picture of hers.""So?[DIALOGUE]" said Hoyt, meditatively. "Well, she’s kept her word, hasn’t she?"The two stood looking at the pictures for a time. Then Hoyt pointed tothe open blaze in the grate.
[W BOB HOLLAND][DANGER][PROBLEM][ACTION][CONFLICT][WEAPON][DIALOGUE]"Throw them in," he commanded. [DIALOGUE]"Don’t let your father see them--don’tkeep them yourself. They wouldn’t be good things to keep."[DIALOGUE]"That’s true enough," said the lady, slowly. And she threw them in thefire. Then Virgil Hoyt brought out the plates and broke them before hereyes.
[W BOB HOLLAND][METAPHOR][GHOST]And that was the end of it--except that Hoyt sometimes tells the storyto those who sit beside him when his pipe is lighted.THE GHOST OF A LIVE MAN.We were in the South Atlantic Ocean, in the latitude of the island ofFernando Norohna, about 40 degrees 12 minutes south, on board the barqueH. G. Johnson, homeward bound from Australia. I was the only passenger,
[W BOB HOLLAND][CHARACTER]and we had safely rounded Cape Horn, with the barometer at 28 degrees 18minutes, and yet had somehow miraculously escaped any extremely heavygale--had had light northerly and easterly winds till we reached 20degrees, and thence the southeast trades were sending us fast on our wayto the equator. I sat on deck smoking my pipe, with a glorious full moonshedding its bright pathway across the blue waters, and chatting withthe first mate, a man some fifty-eight years of age, who had followedthe sea since he was a boy. For twenty years or more he had been mate orcaptain, and many and varied were the experiences he could relate. Athorough sailor and skillful navigator, he was as honest as the day islong--had a heart as big as an ox and was an all-round good fellow andgenial companion. Some of his yarns might be taken cum grano salis, yet
[W BOB HOLLAND][FLASHBACK][CONTEXT][ACTION][PERSPECTIVE]he always positively assured me that he [DIALOGUE]"was telling me the truth." Anaccount of a voyage that he made in a whaler from the Southern Ocean toNew Bedford seemed to me worthy to be repeated. He had rounded Cape Hornsix times and the Cape of Good Hope twenty-six times, besides makingmany trips across the Western Ocean and to South American ports. I givehis account as near as possible in his own words:"It was in ’71 that I commanded the whaler Mary Jane. We had been outfrom home over three years, and had on board a full cargo of whale oil,besides 2,000 pounds of whalebone, which was then worth $5 per pound. I
[W BOB HOLLAND][EMOTION]also had been fortunate enough to find in a dead whale which we cameacross a large quantity of ambergris, and our hearts were all very lightas we began our homeward voyage, and our thoughts all tended to thehearty welcome which we should receive from wives and sweethearts whenwe reached our journey’s end. Many a night as I lay in my berth I hadthought with great pleasure of the amount of money that would be comingto me from the proceeds of our voyage when we arrived in New Bedford."I calculated that I had made $12,000 as my share of the proceeds of thewhalebone and oil--to say nothing of the ambergris, which I well knewwould bring at least $20,000, and one-half of which belonged to me. Youcan therefore imagine that I was well pleased with myself as we wentbounding along through the southeast trades. We crossed the equator in
[W BOB HOLLAND]longitude 36 and soon after took strong northeast trades, and all wasgoing as well as I could wish. We had put the ship in perfect order,painted her inside and out, and you would never have recognized her asthe old whaling ship that had for three years been plying the SouthernOcean for whales. Never shall I forget an old bull whale that we tackledabout two degrees to the south of Cape Horn--but that is another story,which I will give you another time."We had just lost the northeast trades and were entering the GulfStream. I sat in my cabin with my chart on the table before me rolled
[W BOB HOLLAND]up. I had just picked our location on it, and was thinking that in aweek more I should be at home, surrounded by those near and dear to me,and relating to them the story of my great good fortune."It was always my custom to work up my latitude and longitude about fouro’clock in the afternoon, and then after supper pick off her position onthe chart, have a smoke and perhaps just before retiring a nip of grog,and then at 8.30 o’clock, as regular as a clock, I would turn in.
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][PROBLEM]"I am a great smoker, and this day I had been smoking all the afternoon,besides having had two or three nips. We had a dog on board whom wecalled ‘Bosun,’ who had been out with us all the voyage, and who wasafraid of nothing. He had endeared himself to every man on board, andwhen Bosun ‘took water’ something very serious was in the wind. Thisnight as I sat in the cabin I heard a most dismal howl from Bosun, andcalled out to the mate to know what was the matter with the dog. He
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK][TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][CHARACTER][CHARACTERIZATION][METAPHOR][EXPOSITION]replied that he ‘reckoned some of the men had been teasing him,’ and theoccurrence soon passed from my mind."Suddenly I saw someone coming down the after companion way into thecabin. I supposed at first it was the mate and wondered that he had notfirst spoken to me, but then I noticed that he wore clothes I had neverseen on the mate, and as he advanced into the cabin I saw his face. Itwas the face of a man I had never seen in my life. He was thin and pale
[W BOB HOLLAND]and haggard, and as he advanced he looked about the cabin and at therolled up chart on the table. There seemed to be an appeal in his eyes,and then there swept over his face a look of intense disappointment, andbefore I could move or speak, he had vanished from my sight."Now I am a very practical man, and I at once straightened myself in mychair and said to myself: ‘Well, old man, you have smoked one too manypipes to-day, or else you have had one drink too much, for you have beenasleep in your chair and seen a ghost.’ I was quite satisfied that Ihad had a dream, especially as I called to the mate and asked him if hehad seen anyone come below. He said no; that he had not left the deck
[W BOB HOLLAND][FLASHBACK][CONFLICT][PERSPECTIVE]for the last hour, and the man at the wheel, directly in front of thedoor, was sure no one had entered the cabin, so I convinced myself thatI had had a very vivid dream--though I could not help thinking of thematter all through the next day."At eight o’clock the next evening I sat in the same place with my workjust finished and the chart lying rolled up on the table before me, whensuddenly the dog’s dismal howl rang through the ship, and looking up Isaw those same legs coming down the after companion. My hair fairlystood on end, and yet to-day surely I was wide awake. I had only smokedone pipe all day, and had not touched a drop of liquor. The same wan,
[W BOB HOLLAND][EMOTION][CONFLICT]emaciated figure walked into the cabin, glanced inquiringly andappealingly at me, and again there spread over his face that look ofutter disappointment as if he had sought something and failed to findit, and again he disappeared. I rushed on deck to the mate and told himall I had seen during the last two nights; but he made light of it, andassured me I had been asleep or smoking too much. He did not like tosuggest that I had been drinking. Still, I could see that the thoughtthat came into his mind was ‘The old man has seen ’em again.’ I gave up
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][PERSPECTIVE][TRANSITION][EMOTION][DANGER][GHOST]trying to convince him, but requested that the next night, from 8 to8.30, he should sit with me in the cabin."How the next day passed I cannot tell. I only know that my thoughtsnever left that ghostly visitant, and somehow I felt that the eveningwould reveal something to me and the spell be broken. I made up my mind
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][HORROR]I would speak to the thing, whatever it was, and I felt a sort ofsecurity in the presence of the mate, who was a daring fellow and fearedneither man nor the devil. Neither rum nor tobacco passed my lips duringthe next day, and eight o’clock found the mate and I sitting in thecabin, and this time the chart lay open on the table beside us. Just aseight bells struck the dog’s premonitory wail sounded, and looking up weboth saw the figure descending the cabin stairs. We both seemed frozento our seats, and the strange weirdness of the whole proceeding cast thesame spell over the mate and me alike, and we were both unable to moveor speak. Slowly the figure proceeded into the cabin and glanced around
[W BOB HOLLAND][EMOTION][TRANSITION]without a word, but with the same expectant look on his face. His formwas even more wasted, his cheeks sunken and his eyes seemed almost outof sight so deeply were they set in their sockets. As his eye fell onthe open chart a look of supreme joy fairly irradiated his features, andadvancing to the table he placed one long, bony finger on the chart,held it for a moment and then again disappeared from our sight."For five minutes after he had left us we sat speechless. Then I managed
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][PROBLEM]to say: ‘What do you think of that, Mr. Morris?’ ‘My God! sir, I don’tknow--it’s beyond me.’ Then my eyes fell on the open chart and therewhere the finger had been was a tiny spot of blood, exactly on the pointof longitude 63 degrees west and latitude 37 degrees north. We were then
[W BOB HOLLAND][ACTION][TRANSITION]only about fifty miles distant from that position, and immediately therecame to me the determination to steer the ship there; so I laid hercourse accordingly, and posted a lookout in the crow’s nest. At fiveo’clock in the morning, just as the east began to grow gray, the lookoutcalled out: ‘Boat on the lee bow,’ and as we came up to it we found fourmen in it--three dead and one with just a remnant of life left in him.We sewed the three bodies in canvas and buried them in the ocean, andthen gave all our attention to restoring life to the poor emaciatedframe, which, I then recognized, was the very man who for threesuccessive nights had visited me in my cabin."By judicious and careful nursing life gradually came back to him, andin four days’ time he was able to sit up and talk with me in the cabin.
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE]It seems he commanded the ship Promise, and she had taken fire and beendestroyed, and all hands had to take to the boats. Ten were in the boatsat first, but their food had given out, and one by one he had seen themdie, and one by one he had cast the bodies overboard. Finally he lostconsciousness and knew not whether his three remaining companions weredead or alive."Then he said he seemed in a dream to see a ship and tried to go to herfor help, but just as he would be going on board of her something wouldseem to keep him back; three times in his dreams he tried to visit thisship, and the last time there seemed to come to him a certainsatisfaction, and he felt that he had succeeded in his object. Turning
[W BOB HOLLAND]to my table, he said: ‘Let me take your chart; I’ll show you just wherewe were.’"‘Stop,’ said I, ‘don’t take that chart, it is an old one and all markedover. Mark your position on this new one.’ He took my pencil and knife,and carefully sharpened his pencil. Then, taking my dividers, he
[W BOB HOLLAND][GHOST]measured his latitude and longitude and placed a pencil dot at a pointon the clean chart. As he lifted his hand he said: ‘Oh, excuse me,captain, I cut my finger in sharpening the pencil and have left a dropof blood on the chart.’[DIALOGUE]"‘Never mind,’ said I, ‘leave it there.’ And then I produced the oldchart and there, in an exactly corresponding place was the drop of bloodleft by my ghostly visitor."Then looking steadily into my face the mate solemnly added: [DIALOGUE]"I can’texplain this, sir, perhaps you can; but I can tell you on my honor it isGod’s own truth that I have told you."THE GHOST OF WASHINGTON.It was early on Christmas morning when John Reilly wheeled away from apicturesque little village where he had passed the previous night, tocontinue his cycling tour through eastern Pennsylvania. To-day his
[W BOB HOLLAND]intention was to stop at Valley Forge, and then to ride on up theSchuylkill Valley, visiting in turn the many points of historicalinterest that lay along his route. Valley Forge, his road map indicated,was but a short distance further on. All around him were the hills andfields and roads over which Washington and his half-starved army hadforaged and roamed throughout the trying winter of 1777-8--one hundredand twenty-six years ago.It was a beautiful Christmas day, truly, and, as he wheeled along, youngReilly’s thoughts were almost equally divided between the surroundingpleasant scenery and the folks at home, who, he knew very well, wereassembling at just about the present time around a heavily ladenChristmas tree in the front parlor. The sun rose higher and higher and
[W BOB HOLLAND]Reilly pedaled on down the valley, passing every now and then quaint,pleasant-looking farmhouses, many of which, no doubt, had been builtanterior to the period which had given the vicinity its history.Arriving, finally, at a place where the road forked off in twodirections, Reilly was puzzled which way to go on. There happened to bea dwelling close by. Accordingly he dismounted, left his wheel leaningagainst a gate-post at the side of the road, and walked up a wretchedlyflagged walk leading to the house, with the idea of getting instructionsfrom its inmates.
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE]Situated in the center of an unkempt field of rank grass and weeds, thebuilding lay back from the highway probably one hundred and fifty feet.It was long and low in shape, containing but one story and having whatis termed a gabled roof, under which there must have been an attic of nomean size. On coming close to the house, a fact Reilly had not noticedfrom the road became plainly evident. It was deserted. He saw that the
[W BOB HOLLAND]roof and side shingles were in wretched condition; that the windowsashes and frames as well as the doors and door frames were missing fromthe openings in the side walls where once they had been, and that theentire side of the house, including that part of the stone foundationwhich showed above the ground, was full of cracks and seams. At first onthe point of turning back, he concluded to see what the interior waslike anyway.Accordingly he went inside. Glancing around the large dust-filled roomhe had entered his gaze at first failed to locate any object of theleast interest. A rickety appearing set of steps went up into the atticfrom one side of the apartment and over in one corner was a large openfireplace, from the walls of which much of the brickwork had becomeloosened and fallen out. Reilly had started up the steps toward the
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE]attic, when happening to look back for an instant, his attention wasattracted to a singular-looking, jug-shaped bottle no larger than avinegar cruet, which lay upon its side on the hearth of the fireplace,partly covered up by debris of loose bricks and mortar. He hastened backdown the steps and crossed the room, taking the bottle up in his handand examining it with curiosity. Being partly filled with a liquid ofsome kind or other the bottle was very soon uncorked and held under theyoung man’s nose. The liquid gave forth a peculiar, pungent and invitingodor. Without further hesitation Reilly’s lips sought the neck of the
[W BOB HOLLAND][EMOTION][RELIEF][SURPRISE]bottle. It is hardly possible to describe the pleasure and satisfactionhis senses experienced as he drank.While the fluid was still gurgling down his throat a heavy hand wasplaced most suddenly on his shoulder and his body was given a violentshaking. The bottle fell to the floor and was broken into a hundredpieces.
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][DIALOGUE]"Hello!" said a rough voice almost in Reilly’s ear. [DIALOGUE]"Who are you,anyway? And what are you doing within the lines? A spy, I’ll be bound."As most assuredly there had been no one else in the vicinity of thebuilding when he had entered it and with equal certainty no one had comedown the steps from the attic, Reilly was naturally surprised andmystified by this unexpected assault. He struggled instinctively tobreak loose from the unfriendly grasp, and when he finally succeeded hetwisted his body around so that he faced across the room. Immediately hemade the remarkable discovery that there were four other persons in theapartment--three uncouth-looking fellows habited in fantastic but raggedgarments, and a matronly-looking woman, the latter standing over awashtub which had been elevated upon two chairs in a corner near thefireplace. To all appearance the woman had been busy at her work and had
[W BOB HOLLAND][TRANSITION]stopped for the moment to see what the men were going to do; her waistsleeves were rolled up to the shoulders and her arms dripped with waterand soapsuds. Over the tops of the tubs, partly filled with water, therewere visible the edges of several well-soaked fabrics. Too add to hisastonishment he noticed that in the chimney-place, which a moment beforewas falling apart, but now seemed to be clean and in good condition, acheerful fire burned, and that above the flames was suspended an ironpot, from which issued a jet of steam. He noticed also that the entireappearance of the room had undergone a great change. Everything seemed
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][EMOTION]to be in good repair, tidy and neat; the ceilings, the walls and thedoor; even the stairway leading to the attic. The openings in the wallswere fitted with window sashes and well-painted doors. The apartmenthad, in fact, evolved under his very eyesight from a state of absoluteruin into one of excellent preservation.All of this seemed so weird and uncanny, that Reilly stood for a momentor two in the transformed apartment, utterly dumbfounded, with his mouthwide open and his eyes all but popping out of his head. He was brought
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE]to his senses by the fellow who had shaken him growling out:[DIALOGUE]"Come! Explain yourself!"[DIALOGUE]"An explanation is due me," Reilly managed to gasp.[DIALOGUE]"Don’t bandy words with the rascal, Harry," one of the other men spokeup. [DIALOGUE]"Bring him along to headquarters."Thereupon, without further parley, the three men marched Reilly inmilitary fashion into the open air and down to the road. Here he pickedup at the gate-post his bicycle, while they unstacked a group of threeold-fashioned-looking muskets located close by. When the young man hadentered the house a few minutes before, this stack of arms had not beenthere. He could not understand it. Neither could he understand, on
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][TRANSITION]looking back at the building as he was marched off down the road, themysterious agency that had transformed its dilapidated exterior, just ashad been the interior, into a practically new condition.While they trudged along, the strangers exhibited a singular interest inthe wheel Reilly pushed at his side, running their coarse hands over theframe and handle-bar, and acting on the whole as though they neverbefore had seen a bicycle. This in itself was another surprise. He hadhardly supposed there were three men in the country so totallyunacquainted with what is a most familiar piece of mechanism everywhere.
[W BOB HOLLAND]At the same time that they were paying so much attention to the wheel,Reilly in turn was studying with great curiosity his singular-lookingcaptors. Rough, unprepossessing appearing fellows they were, large offrame and unshaven, and, it must be added, dirty of face. What remainedof their very ragged clothing, he had already noticed, was of a mostremarkable cut and design, resembling closely the garments worn by theContinental militiamen in the War of Independence. The hats were broad,low of crown, and three-cornered in shape; the trousers werebuff-colored and ended at the knees, and the long, blue spike-tailedcoats were flapped over at the extremities of the tails, the flaps beingfastened down with good-sized brass buttons. Leather leggings were
[W BOB HOLLAND]strapped around cowhide boots, through the badly worn feet of which, inplaces where the leather had cracked open, the flesh, unprotected bystockings, could be seen. Dressed as he was, in a cleanly, gray cyclingcostume, Reilly’s appearance, most assuredly, was strongly in contrastto that of his companions.After a brisk walk of twenty minutes, during which they occasionally metand passed by one or two or perhaps a group of men clothed and outfittedlike Reilly’s escorts, the little party followed the road up a slightincline and around a well-wooded bend to the left, coming quitesuddenly, and to the captive, very unexpectedly, to what was withoutdoubt a military encampment; a village, in fact, composed of many rowsof small log huts. Along the streets, between the buildings, musketswere stacked in hundreds of places. Over in one corner, on a slight
[W BOB HOLLAND]eminence commanding the road up which they had come, and cleverly hiddenfrom it behind trees and shrubbery, the young man noticed a battery offield pieces. Wherever the eye was turned on this singular scene werecountless numbers of soldiers all garmented in three-cornered hats,spike-tailed coats and knee breeches, walking lazily hither and thither,grouped around crackling fires, or parading up and down the streets inplatoons under the guidance of ragged but stern-looking officers.Harry stopped the little procession of four in front of one of thelarger of the log houses. Then, while they stood there, the long blastfrom a bugle was heard, followed by the roll of drums. A minute or twoafterward, several companies of militia marched up and grounded theirarms, forming three sides of a hollow square around them, the fourthand open side being toward the log house. Directly succeeding this
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][CHARACTER][EMOTION][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][DANGER][FLASHBACK][PERSPECTIVE][HORROR]maneuver there came through the doorway of the house and stepped up thecenter of the square, stopping directly in front of Reilly, adignified-looking person, tall and straight and splendidly proportionedof figure, and having a face of great nobility and character.The cold chills chased one another down Reilly’s back. His limbs swayedand tottered beneath his weight. He had never experienced another suchsensation of mingled astonishment and fright.
[W BOB HOLLAND]He was in the presence of General Washington. Not a phantom Washington,either, but Washington in the flesh and blood; as material and earthly abeing as ever crossed a person’s line of vision. Reilly, in his time,had seen so many portraits, marble busts and statues of the greatcommander that he could not be mistaken. Recovering the use of hisfaculties, which for the moment he seemed to have lost, Reilly did thevery commonplace thing that others before him have done when placedunexpectedly in remarkable situations. He pinched himself to make sure
[W BOB HOLLAND]that he was in reality wide awake and in the natural possession of hissenses. He felt like pinching the figure in front of him also, but hecould not muster up the courage to do that. He stood there trying tothink it all out, and as his thoughts became less stagnant, his frightdissolved under the process of reasoning his mind pursued. To reason athing out, even though an explanation can only be obtained by leavingmuch of the subject unaccounted for, tends to make one bolder and lessshaky in the knees.
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][CONFLICT]The series of strange incidents which he was experiencing had beeninaugurated in the old-fashioned dwelling he had visited afterinformation concerning the roads. And everything had been going along ina perfectly normal way up to, the very moment when he had taken a drinkfrom the bottle found in the fireplace. But from that precise timeeverything had gone wrongly. Hence the inference that the drinking ofthe peculiar liquid was accountable in some way or other for histroubles. There was a supernatural agency in the whole thing. That much
[W BOB HOLLAND]must be admitted. And whatever that agency was, and however it might beaccounted for, it had taken Reilly back into a period of time more thana hundred years ago, and landed him, body and soul, within the lines ofthe patriot forces wintering at Valley Forge. He might have stood there,turning over and over in his mind, pinching himself and muttering, allthe morning, had not the newcomer ceased a silent but curious inspectionof his person, and asked: [DIALOGUE]"Who are you, sir?"[DIALOGUE]"John Reilly, at your pleasure," the young man replied, adding aquestion on his own account: [DIALOGUE]"And who are you, sir?"Immediately he received a heavy thump on his back from Harry’s hardfist.[DIALOGUE]"It is not for you to question the general," the ragged administrator ofthe blow exclaimed.[DIALOGUE]"And it is not for you to be so gay," Reilly returned, angrily, givingthe blow back with added force.[DIALOGUE]"Here, here!" broke in the first questioner. [DIALOGUE]"Fisticuffs under my verynose! No more of this, I command you both." To Harry he added an extracaution: [DIALOGUE]"Your zeal in my behalf will be better appreciated by beingless demonstrative. Blows should be struck only on the battlefield." ToReilly he said, with a slight smile hovering over his face, [DIALOGUE]"My name isWashington. Perhaps you may have heard of me?"To this Reilly replied: [DIALOGUE]"I have, indeed, and heard you very well spokenof, too." Emboldened by the other’s smile, he ventured another question:"I think my reckoning of the day and year is badly at fault. An hour ago
[W BOB HOLLAND][DANGER][PROBLEM]I thought the day was Christmas day. How far out of the way did mycalculation take me, sir?[DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE]""The day is indeed Christmas day, and the year is, as you must know, theyear of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-seven.[DIALOGUE]"Reilly again pinched himself."Why do you bring this man to me?[DIALOGUE]" Washington now inquired, turning toHarry and his companions."He is a spy, sir,[DIALOGUE]" said Harry."That is a lie![DIALOGUE]" Reilly indignantly interpolated. "I have done nothingto warrant any such charge.""We found him in the Widow Robin’s house, pouring strong liquor down histhroat.""I had gone inside after information concerning the roads----""Which he was getting from a bottle, sir.""If drinking from a bottle of necessity constitutes being a spy, I fearour camp is already a hotbed,[DIALOGUE]" Washington somewhat sagely remarked,casting his eye around slyly at his officers and men. "Tell me," he went
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE]on, with sudden sternness, looking Reilly through and through, as thoughto read his very thoughts, [DIALOGUE]"is the charge true? Do you come from Howe?"[DIALOGUE]"The charge is not true, sir. I come from no one. I simply am making atour of pleasure through this part of the country on my bicycle."[DIALOGUE]"With the country swarming with the men from two hostile armies, anykind of a tour, save one of absolute necessity, seems ill-timed."[DIALOGUE]"When I set out I knew nothing about any armies. The fact is, sir----"Reilly started to make an explanation, but he checked himself onrealizing that the telling of any such improbable yarn would onlyincrease the hazardousness of his position.[DIALOGUE]"Well?" Washington questioned, in a tone of growing suspicion.[DIALOGUE]"I certainly did not know that your army or any other army wasquartered in this vicinity." Reilly hesitated for lack of somethingfurther to say. [DIALOGUE]"You see," he finally added, prompted by a happy idea,[DIALOGUE]"I rode my wheel from New York.""You may have come from New York, though it is hard to believe you cameon that singular-looking machine so great a distance. Where is the horse
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][CONTEXT][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][DANGER][METAPHOR][HORROR]which drew the vehicle?[DIALOGUE]"Reilly touched his bicycle. "This is the horse, sir, just as it is; thevehicle,[DIALOGUE]" he said."The man is crazy!" Harry exclaimed. Washington only looked theincredulity he felt, and this time asked a double question.
[W BOB HOLLAND][ACTION][DIALOGUE]"How can the thing be balanced without it be held upright by a pair ofshafts from a horse’s back, and how is the motive power acquired?"For an answer Reilly jumped upon the wheel, and at a considerable speedand in a haphazard way pedaled around the space within the hollow squareof soldiers. Hither and thither he went, at one second nearly wheelingover the toes of the line of astonished, if not frightened, militiamen;at the next, bearing suddenly down on Harry and his companions andmaking them dance and jump about most alertly to avoid a collision. Eventhe dignified Washington was once or twice put to the necessity ofdodging hurriedly aside when his equilibrium was threatened. Reillyeventually dismounted, doing so with assumed clumsiness by stopping thewheel at Harry’s back and falling over heavily against the soldier.
[W BOB HOLLAND]Harry tumbled to the ground, but Reilly dexterously landed on his feet.At once he began offering a profusion of apologies.[DIALOGUE]"You did that by design!" Harry shouted, jumping to his feet. His facewas red with anger and he shook his fist threateningly at the bicyclist.Washington commanded the man to hold his peace. Then to Reilly he
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE]expressed a great surprise at his performance and a desire to know moreabout the bicycle. The young man thereupon described the machineminutely, lifting it into the air and spinning the wheels to illustratehow smoothly they rotated.[DIALOGUE]"I can see it is possible to ride the contrivance with rapidity. It hasbeen put together with wonderful ingenuity," Washington said, whenReilly had replaced the wheel on the ground.[DIALOGUE]"And you, sir, it is but a toy," an officer spoke up. [DIALOGUE]"Put our friend onhis bundle of tin and race him against one of our horsemen and he wouldmake a sorry showing."Reilly smiled. [DIALOGUE]"I bear the gentleman no ill-will for his opinion," hesaid. "Still, I should like to show him by a practical test of the
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][PROBLEM]subject that his ignorance of it is most profound.[DIALOGUE]""You would test the speed of the machine against that of a horse?[DIALOGUE]"Washington said, in amazement."I would, sir. You have a good road yonder. With your permission and a
[W BOB HOLLAND][PROBLEM][DANGER][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][MURDER]worthy opponent I would make the test at once.[DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE]""But, sir, the man is a spy,[DIALOGUE]" Harry broke in. "Would it not be better tothrow a rope around his neck and give him his deserts?""The charge is by no means proven,[DIALOGUE]" Washington replied. "Nor can it beuntil a court martial convenes this afternoon. And I see no reason why
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][RELIEF][PERSPECTIVE]we may not in the meantime enjoy the unique contest which has beensuggested. It will make a pleasant break in the routine of camp life."A murmur of approval went up from the masses of men by whom they weresurrounded. While they had been talking it seemed as though everybody inthe camp not already on the scene had gathered together behind thesquare of infantry.
[W BOB HOLLAND][DIALOGUE]"Then, sir," Harry said, with some eagerness, [DIALOGUE]"I would like to be theman to ride the horse. There is no better animal than mine anywhere. AndI understand his tricks and humors quite well enough to put him to hisbest pace."[DIALOGUE]"I confess I have heard you well spoken of as a horseman," Washingtonsaid. [DIALOGUE]"Be away with you! Saddle and bridle your horse at once."It was the chain of singular circumstances narrated above which broughtJohn Reilly into the most remarkable contest of his life. He had enteredmany bicycle races at one time or other, always with credit to himselfand to the club whose colors he wore. And he had every expectation ofmaking a good showing to-day. Yet a reflection of the weird conditions
[W BOB HOLLAND][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][PERSPECTIVE]which had brought about the present contest took away some of hisself-possession when a few minutes later he was marched over to theturnpike and left to his own thoughts, while the officers were pacingout a one mile straightaway course down the road.After the measurements had been taken, two unbroken lines of soldierswere formed along the entire mile; a most evident precaution againstReilly leaving the race course at any point to escape across the fields.Washington came up to him again, when the preparations were completed,to shake his hand and whisper a word or two of encouragement in his ear.Having performed these kindly acts he left to take up a position nearthe point of finish.
[W BOB HOLLAND][METAPHOR][EMOTION][FLASHBACK]The beginning of the course was located close to the battery of halfconcealed field pieces. Reilly was now conducted to this place. Shortlyafterward Harry appeared on his horse. He leered at the bicyclistcontemptuously and said something of a sarcastic nature partly under hisbreath when the two lined up, side by side, for the start. To these
[W BOB HOLLAND][ACTION]slights Reilly paid no heed; he had a strong belief that when the racewas over there would be left in the mutton-like head of his opponentvery little of his present inclination toward the humorous. Thesoldier’s mount was a handsome black mare, fourteen and a half handshigh; strong of limbs and at the flanks, and animated by a spirit thatkept her prancing around with continuous action. It must be admittedthat the man rode very well. He guided the animal with ease andnonchalance when she reared and plunged, and kept her movements confinedto an incredibly small piece of ground, considering her abundance ofaction.
[W BOB HOLLAND][DIALOGUE]"Keep to your own side of the road throughout the race. I don’t want tobe collided with by your big beast," Reilly cautioned, while they wereawaiting two signals from the starter.To this Harry replied in some derision, [DIALOGUE]"I’ll give you a good share ofthe road at the start, and all of it and my dust, too, afterward." Andthen the officer who held the pistol fired the first shot.Reilly was well satisfied with the conditions under which the race wasto be made. The road was wide and level, smooth, hard and straight, anda strong breeze which had sprung up, blew squarely against his back. His
[W BOB HOLLAND]wheel was geared up to eighty-four inches; the breeze promised to be avaluable adjunct in pushing it along. Awaiting the second and lastsignal, Reilly glanced down the two blue ranks of soldiers, whichstretched away into hazy lines in the distance and converged at thetermination of the course where a flag had been stuck into the ground.The soldiers were at parade rest. Their unceasing movements as theychatted to one another, turning their bodies this way and that andcraning their heads forward to look toward the starting point, and thenjerking them back, made the lines seem like long, squirming snakes. At
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][ACTION][DANGER][CLIMAX][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][SETTING][WEAPON][PROBLEM]the end of the course a thick bunch of militiamen clogged the road andoverspread into the fields.Crack! The signal to be off. Reilly shoved aside the fellow who had beenholding his wheel upright while astride of it, and pushed down on thepedals. The mare’s hoofs dug the earth; her great muscular legs
[W BOB HOLLAND][EMOTION]straightened out; she sprang forward with a snort of apparent pleasure,taking the lead at the very start. Reilly heard the shout of excitementrun along the two ranks of soldiers. He saw them waving their arms andhats as he went by. And on ahead through the cloud of dust there wasvisible the shadow-like outlines of the snorting, galloping horse, whosehoof beats sounded clear and sharp above the din which came from thesides of the highway. The mare crept farther and farther ahead. Very
[W BOB HOLLAND]soon a hundred feet or more of the road lay between her and thebicyclist. Harry turned in his saddle and called out another sarcasm.[DIALOGUE]"I shall pass you very soon. Keep to your own side of the road!" Reillyshouted, not a bit daunted by the way the race had commenced. His headwas well down over the handle-bars, his back had the shape of the upperportion of an immense egg. Up and down his legs moved; faster andfaster and faster yet. He went by the soldiers so rapidly that they only
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][METAPHOR]appeared to be two streaks of blurry color. Their sharp rasping shoutssounded like the cracking of musketry. The cloud of dust blew againstthe bicyclist’s head and into his mouth and throat. When he glancedahead again he saw with satisfaction that the mare was no longerincreasing her lead. It soon became evident even that he was slowly
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][DANGER][PROBLEM][ACTION][MONSTER]cutting down the advantages she had secured.Harry again turned his head shortly afterward, doubtless expecting tofind his opponent hopelessly distanced by this time. Instead of thisReilly was alarmingly close upon him. The man ejaculated a sudden oathand lashed his animal furiously. Straining every nerve and sinew the
[W BOB HOLLAND][TRANSITION][FLASHBACK][CONFLICT][ACTION]mare for the moment pushed further ahead. Then her pace slackened a bitand Reilly again crept up to her. Closer and closer to her than before,until his head was abreast of her outstretched tail. Harry was lashingthe mare and swearing at her unceasingly now. But she had spurted once
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][ACTION]and appeared to be incapable of again increasing her speed. In this waythey went on for some little distance, Harry using his whip brutally,the mare desperately struggling to attain a greater pace, Reilly hangingon with tenacity to her hind flanks and giving up not an inch of ground.A mile is indeed a very short distance when traversed at such a pace.The finishing flag was already but a few hundred feet further on.
[W BOB HOLLAND][EMOTION][ACTION][TRANSITION][CONFLICT]Reilly realized that it was time now to go to the front. He gritted histeeth together with determination and bent his head down even furthertoward his front wheel. Then his feet began to move so quickly thatthere was only visible an indistinct blur at the sides of his crankshaft. At this very second, with a face marked with rage and hatred,Harry brought his horse suddenly across the road to thet part of itwhich he had been warned to avoid.
[W BOB HOLLAND][EMOTION][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][ACTION][DANGER][FLASHBACK][PROBLEM]It is hard to tell what kept Reilly from being run into and trampledunder foot. An attempt at back pedaling, a sudden twist of thehandle-bar, a lurch to one side that almost threw him from his seat.Then, in the fraction of a second he was over on the other side of theroad, pushing ahead of the mare almost as though she were standingstill. The outburst of alarm from the throats of the soldiers changedwhen they saw that Reilly had not been injured; first into a shout ofindignation at the dastardly attempt which had been made to run himdown, and then into a roar of delight when the bicyclist breasted theflag a winner of the race by twenty feet.
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][TRANSITION][FLASHBACK]As he crossed the line Reilly caught a glimpse of Washington. He stoodclose to the flag and was waving his hat in the air with the enthusiasmof a schoolboy. Reilly went on down the road slackening his speed aseffectively as he could. But before it was possible to entirely stophis wheel’s momentum the noisy acclamations in his rear ceased withstartling suddenness. He turned in his saddle and looked back. As sure
[W BOB HOLLAND][SURPRISE][TRANSITION]as St. Peter he had the road entirely to himself. There wasn’t a soldieror the ghost of a soldier in sight.As soon as he could he turned his bicycle about and rode slowly backalong the highway, now so singularly deserted, looking hither andthither in vain for some trace of the vanished army. Even the flag which
[W BOB HOLLAND][TRANSITION]had been stuck into the ground at the end of the one-mile race coursewas gone. The breeze had died out again and the air was tranquil andwarm. In the branches of a nearby tree two sparrows chirped andtwittered peacefully. Reilly went back to the place where the camp hadbeen. He found there only open fields on one side of the road and a
[W BOB HOLLAND][CONFLICT][DANGER][PROBLEM]clump of woodland on the other. He continued on down the little hill upwhich Harry and his companions had brought him a few hours previouslyand followed the road on further, coming finally to the fork in it nearwhich was located the old farmhouse wherein he had been taken captive.The house was, as it had been when he had previously entered it, fallingapart from age and neglect. When he went inside he found lying on thebrick hearth in front of the fireplace a number of pieces of brokenglass.
