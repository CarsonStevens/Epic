[CHARACTER][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][DEATH][CHARACTERIZATION][METAPHOR][HORROR]It gets longer and takes on the shape of a man.TIGHT ON THE AFTERNOON SUN, blinding us. Into the FOREGROUND lurches THE FIGURE which cast the shadow. Glare obscures all facial detail until the head jogs into position directly in front of the fiery ball in the sky. Then we see its hideous, dead eyes, its blue-grey colour, 
[METAPHOR][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][CHARACTERIZATION][DANGER][GHOST]the blackened wound where a large portion of jaw has been ripped away. This is a ZOMBIE! A MUSIC CHORD SOUNDS and THE MAIN TITLE APPEARS:DAY OF THE DEAD5	EXT. THE CITY - DAYHEAD CREDITS ROLL over A MONTAGE: the CITY STREETS are now populated by the WALKING DEAD. In every shape, size and colour they wander, 
[TRANSITION]without purpose, up and down the avenues, in and out of buildings. The city is theirs, they have inherited the place. Man, in his human form, seems to be gone.As the CREDITS END, we CUT TO:6	EXT. A MAIN STREET - DAY
[DEATH][PERSPECTIVE][MONSTER]We are looking down from a HIGH ANGLE. The corner of A TALL BUILDING is in the FOREGROUND. A CORPSE is dangling from A NOOSE. It's been dead for some time. It's mostly bone now, its blackened flesh picked 
[EMOTION][METAPHOR][CHARACTERIZATION][TRANSITION][EXPOSITION][ACTION][SURPRISE][CHARACTER][PERSPECTIVE][CONFLICT][CONTEXT][RESOLUTION][WEAPON]clean by scavenger birds and harbour rats. A SIGN flaps against its chest cavity. Its hurriedly scrawled message reads: TAKE ME, LORD! I LOVE YOU!
[SURPRISE][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][ACTION][CLIMAX][FLASHBACK]THE ROPE BREAKS suddenly and THE CORPSE FALLS out of frame.7	EXT. THE STREET - DAYWe're at GROUND LEVEL now...SMACK!!! THE CORPSE HITS THE PAVEMENT and

[METAPHOR]10	EXT. THE MARINA (CLOSE ON THE FISHING BOAT) - DAYThere are people on board, THREE MEN AND TWO WOMEN. They look like guerilleros from somewhere in Latin America. They're heavily armed, unshaven, covered with months worth of jungle crud. They are 
[METAPHOR][DANGER][PERSPECTIVE][CHARACTERIZATION]obviously exhausted. They gaze up to the city. Their deep-sunken eyes are too war-weary to show much emotion but we can read their despair.TONYAnother dead place. I tol' you. Let's get 
[DEATH][PROBLEM][METAPHOR][DANGER][CONTEXT][CONFLICT][MURDER]out to the islands.MIGUELThe radio signals were coming from this area.TONYNot from the city. In every city it's the same. Dead. Let's get out to the barrier 
[PERSPECTIVE]islands. If there are survivors sending those signals that's where we'll find them.MIGUELPlenty of time for the islands. The rest of our...life...on the islands...I think.
[FLASHBACK][TRANSITION][HORROR]Miguel is drifting. The sight of the dead city has pushed him a few inches closer to the brink of insanity. He catches himself and comes back toward reality.MIGUELWe gotta see if there are others here. We 
[METAPHOR][EXPOSITION][WEAPON]came all this way. We're gonna check it out.11	EXT. THE MARINA (AT THE DOCKS) - DAYCLOSE ON THE OPEN GASOLINE RECEPTACLE in the hull of AN ABANDONED BOAT. A WOMAN'S HANDS shove a LENGTH OF HOSE down into the hole.

THE HARBOUR PARK - DAYTHE TRIO of refugees move across the grass. The WIND blows DEBRIS around them as they stare towards the downtown buildings. MIGUEL

THE HARBOUR PARK - DAYIt comes to MIGUEL AND THE OTHERS as A MASSIVE WALL OF NOISE, THE SOUND of hundreds-of-thousands of damned souls moaning on one solid voice. The sound of hell on earth.

[PERSPECTIVE][PROBLEM]We see the place FROM A GREAT DISTANCE. In the FOREGROUND THE FISHING BOAT, with all five REFUGEES back on board, chugs into open waters.CUT TO:17	EXT.	A SMALL PRIVATE DOCK - DAYAway from the city, this dock is wooden, rickety. DERELICT BOATS rust 
[CONFLICT][TRANSITION][ACTION][EMOTION]at their moorings. THE FISHING BOAT is tied-on at one end of the pier and THE GUERILLEROS are moving through the area, scavenging. This time CHICO helps MARIA with the SIPHON HOSES. TONY lingers sullenly near the fishing boat which has its motor still idling.
[SURPRISE][METAPHOR][CONFLICT][EMOTION][PROBLEM][WEAPON][DANGER][ACTION][EXPOSITION][CHARACTER][WITCH]MARIA'S SIPHON HOSE is stuffed into the gas tank of A LARGE TRAWLER. She sucks on the hose and, unexpectedly, foul tasting liquid fills her mouth.MARIAAY! GASOLINA! GASOLINA!
[SURPRISE][DANGER][ACTION][MURDER]Without warning, A FIGURE pops up from behind the side wall of the trawler. He reaches out and grabs the woman, pulling her against the boat, his arm around her neck, a pistol to her head.TONY sees the action. He dives into the fishing boat, crawls over to his RIFLE and scrambles towards the pilot's controls.
[ACTION][MURDER]With a lightning move, MARIA pulls A KNIFE from her belt. She wrenches around and PLUNGES THE BLADE INTO HER ATTACKER'S CHEST. The man staggers back, screaming. MARIA breaks away and runs across the dock. THE MAN FIRES HIS PISTOL wildly.
[ACTION][CONFLICT][DANGER][WEAPON][TRANSITION][PROBLEM][METAPHOR][SURPRISE][CHARACTER]MARIA IS HIT IN THE ARM. She tumbles forwards onto the decking.TONY reacts, OPENING FIRE WITH HIS AUTOMATIC.BULLETS RIP INTO THE ATTACKERS CHEST: HE FALLS OUT OF THE TRAWLER onto the dock, but TWO MORE GUNMEN appear behind him, mean-looking desperadoes with RIFLE SPITTING LEAD.
[ACTION][CONFLICT][DANGER][WEAPON][MURDER]TONY ducks as low as he can. He grabs the controls and pilots the fishing boat along the edge of the dock toward the downed woman.18	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAYMIGUEL, SARAH AND CHICO react to the gunfire. They draw their WEAPONS 
[TRANSITION][FLASHBACK][PERSPECTIVE]and look for cover.They are at the far end of the dock, their backs to the sea. There is a WORK SHED nearby. BULLETS WHIZ past them as they charge towards the wooden structure. They make it there safely and they begin to RETURN 
[CONFLICT][ACTION][DANGER][TRANSITION][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][MURDER]FIRE. A gun battle ensues between the two groups.19	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAYMARIA, her ARM BLEEDING, rolls off the dock and into THE FISHING BOAT. TONY guns the engine and the boat pulls out into open water.
[SURPRISE][CONFLICT][DANGER][WEAPON][PROBLEM]THE ATTACKERS try to FIRE AT THE ESCAPING BOAT but they are forced to duck BULLETS which RICOCHET OFF THE TRAWLER pinning them down.20	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAYMIGUEL'S RIFLE is in his right hand. His left hand clings to the frame of AN OPEN WINDOW on his side of the shed. There's a SUDDEN, 
[DANGER][CONFLICT][EMOTION][MONSTER]STARTLING MUSIC STING and, with it, A ZOMBIE appears inside the open window. Grotesque and drooling dark SALIVA, its hungry mouth lunges at MIGUEL'S left arm. ITS TEETH TEAR A LARGE STRIP OF FLESH OUT OF THE ARM six inches above the wrist.MIGUEL screams. He pulls away from the creature, his terrified eyes staring at the BLEEDING WOUND. A zombie bite means infection and 
[DANGER][WEAPON][ACTION][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][DEATH][METAPHOR][GHOST]almost certain death.THE ZOMBIE leans out through the open window, its hands clawing the air trying to reach MIGUEL. SARAH pulls A GIANT .45 from her holster belt. BULLAMN! BULLAMN! BULLAMN! She FIRES three rapid shots.
[METAPHOR][TRANSITION][PROBLEM][ACTION][DANGER][DEATH][CHARACTER][CONFLICT][MONSTER]THE SKULL OF THE ZOMBIE INDENTS IN FRONT like a hard-boiled egg shell that's been whacked with a spoon bowl. BLACKENED BLOOD AND BRAIN MATTER FLIES OUT OF THE BACK where the bullets exit. The creature falls, destroyed.21	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY
[ACTION][DANGER][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][WEAPON][METAPHOR][SURPRISE][EXPOSITION]SARAH acts quickly. She lunges towards CHICO and snatches A MACHETE out of his belt. CHICO shows concern but he's busy RETURNING FIRE at THE ATTACKERS on the trawler.SARAHI have to stop the infection... Querrida...
[EMOTION][WEAPON][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][ACTION]	MIGUEL looks into SARAH'S eyes. He has started to tremble. A cry of primal panic is gurgling up in his throat. With a sudden move, SARAH slams her RIFLE BUTT into the side of his head with all her might. He 
reels backwards and slams into the boathouse wall. His eyes roll but he stays on his feet, still conscious.CHICO steps away from his post and stands squarely in front of MIGUEL. WHAP! He slugs him with a powerhouse right-cross. MIGUEL 
[CONFLICT][ACTION][TRANSITION][FLASHBACK][PROBLEM][SURPRISE]still stands. WHAP! He slugs him again. WHAP! Again. Finally, MIGUEL 
[CONFLICT][DANGER][MONSTER]collapses into the man's arms and CHICO lays the limp body down on the deck.BUDDABLAM! RATTATATTATATTATATT! THE ENEMY, sensing an upper hand, starts FIRING WITH MORE INTENSITY. CHICO steps away from MIGUEL and 
[FLASHBACK][EMOTION][TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][CHARACTER][CONTEXT][EXPOSITION][ACTION][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][SURPRISE][WEAPON][SETTING][RELIEF]SENDS SOME LEAD BACK their way.22	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAYSARAH is crying. It's not weakness. She's crying for MIGUEL, crying 
[ACTION][CONFLICT][EMOTION][TRANSITION][WEAPON]for his pain. But she doesn't hesitate in what she has to do. She crouches over the BITTEN ARM and raises the MACHETE over her head.THUCK! SHE CHOPS AT THE ELBOW JOINT with all her strength. THE BLADE 
[ACTION][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][FLASHBACK][PROBLEM][SURPRISE]BITES DEEP BUT DOESN'T CUT THROUGH. SHE LIFTS IT AND CHOPS AGAIN AND AGAIN....THUCK! THUCK! Then SHE DIGS AROUND, searching for the joint 
[EMOTION][TRANSITION][WEAPON][PERSPECTIVE][METAPHOR][ACTION][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][DANGER]the way she might on a turkey drumstick. Finding the spot, SHE PUSHES DOWN WITH BOTH HANDS, leaning all her weight on the top edge of the blade. TEARS are running down her cheeks when THE BIG KNIFE FINALLY.... THUMMMPPP!....CUTS THROUGH TO THE DECKING.
[ACTION]Repulsed, angry, SARAH SWEEPS THE SEVERED FOREARM AWAY WITH THE BLADE the way a butcher might sweep away unwanted fat. BLOOD IS SPURTING OUT OF THE STUMP at an alarming rate. SARAH has to act quickly again.While CHICO continues to RETURN FIRE at the enemy, SARAH swings herself up onto the sill of the open boathouse window and disappears inside the place.
[MONSTER]23	INT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAYThe place is dark and cluttered (oars, bait buckets, fishing gear, life preservers, tools, paints, varnishes). SARAH snatches up AN AXE HANDLE.THE ZOMBIE that bit Miguel lies nearby with its skull laid open. Its 
[TRANSITION][CONFLICT][ACTION][SURPRISE][WEAPON][SETTING][EMOTION][PROBLEM][METAPHOR][FLASHBACK]hand is jogged, startingly, when SARAH grabs A BOTTLE OF PAINT THINNER from the floor beside the corpse.From out of the shadows...A HAND! It grabs SARAH'S ankle. She kicks 
[CONFLICT][ACTION][DANGER][TRANSITION][METAPHOR][PROBLEM][VAMPIRE]violently and pulls away. ANOTHER ZOMBIE is crawling across the floor. ONE OF ITS LEGS IS MISSING AND THE OTHER IS BADLY DAMAGED.SARAH draws her .45 and BULLAMM! BULLAMM! SHE PUMPS TWO ROUNDS INTO 
[CHARACTER][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][DANGER][PROBLEM][METAPHOR][PERSPECTIVE]THE CREATURE'S BRAIN.24	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAYCHICO ducks the enemy's RICOCHETING BULLETS.CHICOHEY ! WHAT ARE WE DOIN' THIS FOR? WE CAN 
[CONFLICT]STICK TOGETHER. WE CAN USE EACH OTHER'S GUNS.At THE TRAWLER, ONE OF THE ATTACKERS shouts a response.ATTACKER #1You could use our guns, maybe. We can't use 
[CONFLICT][DANGER][ACTION][CHARACTERIZATION][CHARACTER][SURPRISE][WEAPON][PROBLEM][TRANSITION][EXPOSITION][METAPHOR]yours. Unless you can get yer boat back here.CHICOYou got a boat.ATTACKER #1Shit, man. We can drift this tub into the 
[ACTION][TRANSITION][DANGER][PROBLEM][WEAPON][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][EXPOSITION]bay...tow her around with a dinghy...but 
[PROBLEM][DEATH][DANGER][HELL]she ain't gonna get us nowhere. Ev'ry boat you see here is long dead, soldier...else 
[SURPRISE][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][DANGER][METAPHOR]we'd be long gone. Can you get your boat back here?CHICOI don't know where they went, man. I don't know. I swear.
[CONFLICT][PROBLEM][DANGER][CHARACTER][CHARACTERIZATION][ACTION][EXPOSITION][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][METAPHOR][MONSTER]ATTACKER #1Then, like I said...we can't use you. We 
[CONFLICT][DANGER][WEAPON][SURPRISE][ACTION][CHARACTER][PROBLEM][CHARACTERIZATION][EXPOSITION][METAPHOR][EMOTION][TRANSITION][CLIMAX][MONSTER]ain't got the food nor the patience to put up with you.The man FIRES A LONG BURST from his automatic.CHICOYOU....YOU MOTHERFUCKERS!
[ACTION][WEAPON][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][DANGER][MURDER]He reaches around the corner of the shed with his own rifle and FIRES blind in return. SARAH clambers out through the shed windows having wrapped A LARGE PIECE OF CLOTH around the end of the AXE HANDLE.	She reaches into a shirt pocket and produces A WOODEN MATCH. She strikes the match and touches the flame to the thinner-soaked cloth. 
[SURPRISE][CONFLICT][ACTION][DANGER][WEAPON][METAPHOR][PROBLEM][TRANSITION][EXPOSITION][HORROR]PHOOOOOMPH! The axe handle becomes an angrily flaming torch.25	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAYAs the gun battle continues, SARAH crouches over MIGUEL. BLOOD IS 
[CONFLICT][DANGER]STILL FOUNTAINING FROM THE STUMP OF HIS LEFT ARM. The woman slaps THE FLAMING END OF HER TORCH ONTO THE STUMP. There's A SIZZLING SOUND as the raw flesh there cooks.The pain reaches MIGUEL even though his unconscious state. He starts 
[CONFLICT]to breathe heavily. His head shakes from side to side silently pleading [DIALOGUE]"NO, NO, NO." The flames do their job. THE FLESH CRUSTS OVER AND THE BLEEDING STOPS.MIGUEL'S SHIRT CATCHES. Suddenly his eyes pop open and he screams 
[METAPHOR][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][CHARACTER][ACTION][DANGER][PERSPECTIVE][EMOTION][CHARACTERIZATION]like the man on fire he is. He lurches away from the flame, his body slamming against the shed wall. SARAH flings the torch into the water and dives on top of the man.SARAHMIGUELITO. MI VIDA. MIGUEL MIO.
[CONFLICT]MIGUEL, trying to scream but needing to vomit, is doing neither. His body is convulsing in the woman's arms. She rubs the sparks on his shirt until they disappear then she caresses him, holding his head against hers, rocking him back and forth.26	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAYCHICO is still busy RETURNING FIRE. BULLETS WHIZ through the air 
[CONFLICT][PROBLEM][EMOTION][DANGER][METAPHOR][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][WEAPON][CHARACTERIZATION][EXPOSITION][ACTION][CHARACTER][FLASHBACK][GHOST]around his head. ONE KNICKS HIM ON THE SHOULDER, a superficial but painful wound.CHICOJESUS CHRIST! GET UP HERE, WOMAN! GET THE 
[CONFLICT][EMOTION][HELL]HELL UP HERE!SARAH has no choice but to help in the fight. She lays MIGUEL as gently as she can on his back. He's gone into deep shock, shivering violently. Rubbing tears away from her eyes, SARAH jumps to her feet, 
[CONFLICT][METAPHOR][EMOTION][WEAPON][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][DANGER][COMEDIC HORROR]takes up a post and begins to FIRE AT THE ATTACKERS.THE ATTACKERS are grinning like old-fashioned pirates as their GUNS CHEW UP THE DOCK. Suddenly, just behind THE TRAWLER, we see A FLASH OF COLOUR SPEEDING BY...
[CONFLICT][WEAPON][ACTION][PROBLEM][TRANSITION][METAPHOR][DANGER][SURPRISE][EXPOSITION]It's THE FISHING BOAT! The WOUNDED MARIA is steering. TONY is standing on the prow with his RIFLE FIRING... 
[SURPRISE][CONFLICT][DANGER][PROBLEM][EMOTION][HORROR]RATTATATTATATTATATTATATT!!!!
[CONFLICT][ACTION]ONE OF THE ATTACKERS IS HIT FROM BEHIND. HIS BACK TURNS SOLID RED and HE PITCHES FORWARDS, FALLING between the boat and the dock into the water below.THE OTHER ATTACKER (#1) turns and FIRES IN RESPONSE. TONY IS HIT IN THE STOMACH. He falls to his knees and grabs the side of the boat but 
[CONFLICT][SURPRISE][DANGER][ACTION][PROBLEM]he KEEPS FIRING.THE ATTACKER pivots against a mast. For a moment he doesn't realise that HIS NECK HAS BEEN RIPPED OPEN BY A LINE OF BULLETS. He tries to scream. Can't. A PLUME OF RED SHOOT OUT OF HIS MOUTH. Then he 
[DEATH][DANGER][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][CHARACTER][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][METAPHOR]realises. He realises that he's a dead man. He falls.MARIATONY....TONY....
[CONFLICT][DANGER][ACTION][TRANSITION][EMOTION][METAPHOR][PROBLEM][SURPRISE]TONYPULL IN! GET THE OTHERS.TONY is clutching at his BLEEDING BELLY as MARIA, in pain from her own wound, circles the boat towards the edge of the dock.27	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY
[WEAPON][CONFLICT][ACTION]Behind the boathouse, SARAH slings her rifle onto her shoulder and she leans over MIGUEL who is now catatonic.SARAHHelp me get him to the boat.CHICOLeave him.SARAH calmly raises her .45 and aims it directly at CHICO's head.
[DANGER][CONFLICT][DEATH][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][RESOLUTION]SARAHHelp me or die.Reluctantly the man moves towards MIGUEL and the two survivors drag his limp body over the decking.DISSOLVE TO:28	EXT. THE PRIVATE DOCK - SUNSETThe fishing boat is gone. Orange light from the western horizon 
[TRANSITION][SETTING][DANGER][PERSPECTIVE][GHOST]paints the scene. FIGURES are moving about on the dock, slumped, lumbering figures....ZOMBIES.
[CHARACTER][ACTION][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][TRANSITION]They're clustering around THE TRAWLER, around THE CORPSES OF THE ATTACKERS.THEY BEGIN PULLING THOSE CORPSES APART AND EATING THEM HUNGRILY.ONE CREATURE has found MIGUEL'S SEVERED FOREARM. IT PULLS A BIG CHUNK OFF THE THING WITH ITS TEETH. It chews for a time, ITS DROOL TURNING 
[CONFLICT][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][DANGER][WITCH]RED. Then it spits out MIGUEL'S WRISTWATCH as though it was a bothersome bit of bone.29	EXT. THE FISHING BOAT (IN DEEP WATER) - SUNSETTHE TWO WOMEN hover over their wounded, TONY AND MIGUEL. CHICO steers 
[EMOTION][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][PROBLEM]the boat. Suddenly, TONY arches his back and screams in pain.TONYAaaaaaah...my God...my God...I am heartily

[CONFLICT][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][CONTEXT][PERSPECTIVE][EMOTION][TRANSITION][CHARACTERIZATION]TONYI detest all my sins...because... because 
[CONTEXT][CHARACTERIZATION]of Thy just punishment... because of Thy...just...punish...
[TRANSITION][CONFLICT][PERSPECTIVE]A coughing fit interrupts his Act of Contrition. From across the open cabin, from within SARAH'S arms, MIGUEL stares. His eyes have the glaze of a madman's eyes. Despite that, and despite the physical trauma he has endured, he seems remarkably in command.
[CONFLICT][DEATH][WEAPON][DANGER][ACTION][EMOTION][PROBLEM][CHARACTER][TRANSITION]MIGUELHe is dying. I will end his pain.MIGUEL draws his PISTOL.MARIANOOOOOOOOO!
[PROBLEM][CONFLICT][DANGER][CHARACTER][SURPRISE][CHARACTERIZATION][MONSTER]TONY...but most of all because...they offend

[EMOTION][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][CHARACTER]TONY collapses. A long, gurgling breath of surrender spills out of him and BLOOD TRICKLES FROM HIS LIFELESS MOUTH.MARIATony...TONY!
[TRANSITION][SURPRISE][WEAPON][CONFLICT][DANGER]The woman folds TONY'S corpse into her arms as though trying to give it life from her own wounded body. For a long moment there is only the CHUG-CHUG-CHUG of the tired engine. Then the woman, sensing something, turns back towards MIGUEL. His pistol is raised, aimed at TONY'S head.
[CONFLICT][ACTION][EMOTION][CONTEXT][PROBLEM]MARIANO! YOU CAN'T!SARAHIt must be done. You know this. It must by

[WEAPON][METAPHOR][ACTION][PROBLEM]MIGUELPrayers have no power to save. The knife can save. It can cut the disease away. The bullet. It can shatter the brain where the

[TRANSITION][CONFLICT][DEATH][PROBLEM][VAMPIRE]MARIAWe must wait. One day the curse will pass. One day a dead man will... will...
[SURPRISE][METAPHOR][DEATH][CHARACTERIZATION]MIGUELOne day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us 
[DANGER][SURPRISE][DEATH][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][METAPHOR][TRANSITION][EMOTION][PERSPECTIVE][WEAPON][CHARACTERIZATION][EXPOSITION][MURDER]to believe.MARIAYou can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do

[DEATH][DANGER][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][MONSTER]be done.MIGUELNo. You won't be able to do it. He will rise. He will rise and you... you will die.
[EMOTION][DANGER][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][FLASHBACK][CHARACTER][MONSTER]That madman's glaze is wet in MIGUEL'S eyes again. A grin curls his mouth into an odd shape. He freezes, staring, waiting. SARAH shows concern.
[TRANSITION][METAPHOR][EXPOSITION]30	EXT. DEEP WATER (WITH THE FISHING BOAT) - NIGHTA CRESCENT MOON lies on its back. Below, on the pitch black water, its reflection, a vertical stripe, breaks open as THE BOAT passes through it...CHUG-CHUG-CHUG.
[WITCH]31	EXT. THE FISHING BOAT (IN DEEP WATER) - NIGHTCHICO has fallen asleep at the tiller. SARAH is asleep as well, and so is MARIA.A SILENT SHADOW moves over the side rail. HANDS reach out and grip 
[SURPRISE][DEATH][METAPHOR][TRANSITION][MONSTER]MARIA'S shoulders, lifting her up, up from sleep. Her eyes flutter open.TONY'S face is blue-grey in the moonlight. It takes the woman a second or two to recognise that HE IS ONE OF THE LIVING DEAD. His 
[CONFLICT][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][EMOTION][EXPOSITION]hungry mouth lunges towards her neck. His DROOLING TEETH SINK DEEP. The woman screams.SARAH wakes with a start. MIGUEL is already awake. He's been watching 
[SURPRISE][WEAPON][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][EMOTION]all along. Now he watches still, his PISTOL idle in his one good hand, his mouth curled in that strange grin, as MARIA'S screams shatter the quiet night.At the tiller, CHICO sees what's happening. He fumbles for the AUTOMATIC RIFLE that's strapped over his shoulder.
[ACTION][CHARACTER][WEAPON][CONFLICT][DANGER][METAPHOR][SURPRISE][MONSTER]A PORK-CHOP-SIZE CHUNK COMES OUT OF MARIA'S NECK IN THE CLENCHED TEETH OF THE TONY-CREATURE. BLOOD SQUIRTS UPWARD IN A FIVE-FOOT ARC.SARAH lifts her RIFLE from her lap. She is the first to FIRE. An 
[ACTION][CONFLICT][DANGER][PROBLEM][CHARACTER][MONSTER]instant later, CHICO FIRES as well.THE HEAD ON THE TONY-CREATURE IS HIT BY RAPID-FIRE LOADS from each gun and IT COME APART ABOVE THE EYES. Its body staggers stiffly into MARIA. She tries to stand, tries to pull away, screams still bubbling in her torn throat. She topples backward over the side rail. The 
[ACTION]corpse, taller and heavier, flips rigidly over, its feet kicking skyward, and splashes in to the deep, black Gulf. MARIA, the small of her back balanced precariously on the side rail, grabs at the air trying to swing her weight back on board. SARAH springs forward. She reaches the other woman a second too late. Their 
[TRANSITION][DANGER][CONFLICT]hands brush but don't catch. MARIA slips over the side. A LOUD SPLASH CUTS OFF HER SCREAMS.CHICO brings the boat about in as tight a circle as possible. He and SARAH stare out over the water. The blackness out there is absolute. 
[METAPHOR][CONTEXT]Visibility zero.Silence....but for the CHUG-CHUG-CHUG of the boat's engine.
[WEAPON][DEATH][MURDER]MIGUEL slowly raises his hand and aims his PISTOL at a LARGE, TURTLE-SHAPED SPLOTCH OF BLOOD on the hull across the cabin, the spot where TONY died. With that odd grin still on his lips, HE BEGINS TO FIRE one shot at a time in deliberate, slow rhythm.THE BULLETS PUNCH HOLES through the wooden side-wall, most of them hitting squarely in the blood stain.SARAH looks over toward CHICO who returns her look with frightened eyes.

[SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][RELIEF]There's no sign that civilisation ever invaded the place, no power lines, no buildings. What meets the eye is all natural and inviting.THE FISHING BOAT chugs into a tidewater basin on the afternoon side of the island.33	EXT. THE FISHING BOAT (IN THE BASIN) - DAY
[METAPHOR][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][CHARACTERIZATION][PROBLEM][PERSPECTIVE][CHARACTER][WEAPON][ACTION][EXPOSITION][DANGER][SETTING][MURDER]CHICOIt looks uninhabited. What do you think?MIGUELI think we should burn the church. Kill the priest and burn the church. It's the only 
[CONFLICT][SURPRISE][DANGER][PROBLEM]way. The only way.MIGUEL is sweating profusely yet shivering as though cold. FLIES ARE BUZZING in a cluster around his WRAPPED STUMP. He's over the edge 
[PROBLEM][DANGER][CONFLICT][EMOTION][VAMPIRE]now, insane. And worse than that, the infection from the original bite is spreading.

THE PLATOON OF SOLDIERS, still obscured by foliage, moves off into the jungle carrying A COLLECTION OF PARAPHERNALIA.There are THREE SOLDIERS who do not move off with the others. They are standing still with their shoulders slumped, their heads lolling listlessly from side to side. They have the body attributes of prisoners yet there's something menacing about them. We HEAR A SERIES

[EMOTION][SURPRISE][ACTION][CHARACTER][WEAPON]All the others in the platoon are humans. They, too, wear vests but theirs are not red but WHITE, WITH LARGE ORANGE CIRCLES emblazoned front and back. Two of the men wield LONG ELECTRIC CATTLE PRODS for use should the ZOMBIES misbehave, but the creatures, amazingly, are shambling along with the rest of the platoon voluntarily, co-operatively, even somewhat excitedly....the kind of excitement seen

[CONFLICT][TRANSITION][ACTION][METAPHOR][EMOTION][VAMPIRE]None are red and none have orange circles.As THE ZOMBIES push in closer they seem to get agitated. They start growling and reaching out. THE MEN WITH THE CATTLE PRODS poke at the more unruly creatures and ZAPPING SOUNDS can be heard.
The creatures form a kind of ragged queue, lining up in front of the [DIALOGUE]"Good Humour" men. From inside their freezer cartons those men produce GREAT BLOODY CHUNKS OF RAW MEAT. THE ZOMBIES docilely take the hand-outs and go lurching out of the queue, some starting to eat immediately, others retreating into the cool of the jungle to enjoy a more private supper.50	EXT.

[EMOTION][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][ACTION][METAPHOR][CHARACTER][RELIEF][EXPOSITION][COMEDIC HORROR]RHODES grins as he watches the spectacle.Suddenly, A LOUD GUNSHOT startles the captain. He drops the binoculars and spins around. He sees...
[CONFLICT][PROBLEM][CHARACTER][METAPHOR][EXPOSITION]...CHICO'S BODY DANGLING ON THE ROPE. CHICO'S HEAD IS BLOODY. He's 
[DEATH][PROBLEM][DANGER][CONFLICT][WEAPON][SURPRISE][MURDER]dead...and won't come back to life. He's been shot through the brain.
[CONFLICT][DANGER][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][METAPHOR][WEAPON][SUSPENSE][HORROR]RHODESWHO FIRED THAT SHOT? WHO FIRED THAT SHOT?SOLDIERS stand around dumbly. Those with RIFLES in their hands quickly sling them onto their shoulders. They're all afraid of the 
[DANGER][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][WEAPON][ACTION][CHARACTER][MURDER]captain's wrath. RHODES walks towards the line of men with fury in his eyes.RHODESGoddammit, somebody's gonna tell me who fired that shot or I'll have every last one of you chopped up for feed!!!
[WEAPON][EMOTION]His eyes spot TOBY, standing behind the crate he dropped earlier, his rifle slung.RHODESStep up here, Tyler.TOBYSir!TOBY shouts the word like a West Point cadet and he bravely steps forward. RHODES stares him down, his anger turning sinister.
[WEAPON][CONFLICT][ACTION][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][EXPOSITION][DANGER][MURDER]RHODESYou fired that shot, didn't you?TOBYNo, sir.RHODESLet me see your weapon.TOBY hands over his rifle. RHODES feels the barrel, sniffs it.
[RELIEF][CONFLICT][EMOTION][METAPHOR][CHARACTER]RHODESIt's been fired.TOBYIn the battle, sir.RHODES is sure he's found the guilty man and he's glad it turned out to be his favourite whipping boy. His body relaxes visibly.
[SURPRISE][METAPHOR][RELIEF][CHARACTERIZATION][HORROR]RHODESIt may be that none of these chicken-shits will talk while the whole troop is present...but I know some of these men well. I'm sure that a few private 
[DANGER][HELL]conversations will tell me what I already know. You may have earned yourself some time in the Stalag, Tyler.(Rhodes glances over at CHICO'S body)Cut him down. That's another head for you to chop off. Leave it with the others. Take 
[TRANSITION][CONFLICT][ACTION][METAPHOR][PROBLEM][CHARACTER][EMOTION][DANGER][EXPOSITION][HELL]the rest of his body down to the freezers. Move it, shit hill.TOBY moves off. RHODES' grin returns.
[FLASHBACK][DANGER][ACTION]CUT TO:73	INT. THE CAVE ENTRANCE - EVENINGThere's that GIANT SOUND again, the RUMBLE OF THE ELEVATOR. We're inside the place called THE CAVE, in a huge under-ground concrete bunker. TECHNICIANS AND ARMED GUARDS bustle around. Enormous 
[SURPRISE]hydraulic pistons are bringing the camouflaged iron plate down from the surface. Riding on board, RHODES AND HIS PLATOON prepare to unload their paraphernalia.74	EXT. THE JUNGLE - EVENINGSARAH, sweating, exhausted, BLEEDING FROM CUTS made by jungle branches, wrings out a piece of cloth torn from her sleeve. She has 
[SURPRISE][GHOST]dipped it into a jungle stream. Cautiously she tastes the water, decides to chance it and squeezes the cloth into her mouth.The NIGHT BIRDS suddenly stop their singing and the quiet makes SARAH look up. Standing across the stream, only ten feet away, is A PARTICULARLY GROTESQUE ZOMBIE. VULTURES stand on the marshy ground 
[DANGER][CONFLICT][ACTION][TRANSITION][WEAPON][CHARACTER][FLASHBACK][PROBLEM][EMOTION][MONSTER]beside the creature's legs, THEIR SHARP BEAKS PICKING BLOODY HOLES IN ITS ANKLES AND FEET.SARAH jumps to her feet, fighting back exhaustion one more time. She unslings her RIFLE, aims it, then thinks better of firing. Grabbing up her SUPPLY PACK she runs into the darkening jungle.
[CONFLICT][DANGER][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][PROBLEM][ACTION][HORROR]75	EXT.	THE JUNGLE - EVENINGWHAM! TWO BIG HANDS GRAB SARAH by her shoulders. She starts to scream but one of those hands shoots up to cover her mouth.
[CHARACTER]JOHNIt's alright. It's alright. Don't be afraid. We're friends.
[CHARACTER][PERSPECTIVE][CHARACTERIZATION][METAPHOR][EXPOSITION][SURPRISE]SARAH looks into the strong, good face of JOHN, a tall muscular man, a Caribbean Islander with shiny black skin and enormous brown eyes that seem instantly trustworthy.JOHNThere are soldiers near here. Guards. I'll take my hand away if you won't scream.
SARAH nods and JOHN lets her go. There are two other humans standing behind the big man. There's BILL McDERMOTT, wearing the grease-covered jump-suit of a mechanic and swilling generous shots of brandy from a hip flask, and there's a smallish woman with a sensitive face who, apparently out of character, is armed to the teeth. She's a deaf mute, nicknamed SPIDER, and she is urgently signing "Come on! Let's 
[CONFLICT][PROBLEM][DANGER][WEAPON][EMOTION][PERSPECTIVE][EXPOSITION][SURPRISE][METAPHOR]get outa here!" with her hands.JOHNRight. We better get away from that Bee. He 
[TRANSITION][ACTION][METAPHOR]might have friends.THE GROUP starts moving. SARAH follows voluntarily. We notice that all three strangers are wearing the same pullover vests that we saw on the foot soldiers, the ones with big orange circles.
[DEATH][METAPHOR][TRANSITION]76	EXT. THE JUNGLE - EVENINGTHE GROUP trudges through thick brushland, occasionally needing to chop a path with their blades. JOHN speaks in low tones as they move.JOHNBees. That's what we call the dead... the

[CHARACTER][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][DANGER][FLASHBACK][HORROR]JOHNThat's the man. He's been holed up here ever since the shit hit the fan. Him and his family owned these islands 'round here. They was leasin' this one to the Fed. The 
[DANGER][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][TRANSITION][ACTION]whole underneath is dug out. There was missiles here and laboratories and bomb proof housing, nuclear power, all o' that. Now this is Dickerson's....Gasparilla's... 
[WEAPON][CHARACTER]private fortress. Him and a bunch o' his cronies from all the best golf courses in Tallahassee...and his private army, of

[DANGER][METAPHOR][PROBLEM][SURPRISE]We ain't supposed to be outside. If we was spotted it could....well, it could be the 
[METAPHOR][TRANSITION][SETTING][CONFLICT][VAMPIRE]end of everything.SPIDER is signing for everyone to be quiet. They all stop in their tracks. BILL McDERMOTT swigs some more brandy. With the stealth of a 
[TRANSITION][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE]Mohican SPIDER pushes aside the branches of a giant oleander and peers through.77	EXT. ENTRANCE TWO - EVENINGThere's A HATCHWAY in sight built into A CONCRETE, BUNKER LIKE STRUCTURE. FOUR OR FIVE SOLDIERS are coming up out of the ground. 
[CONFLICT][METAPHOR]They're armed with PRODS AND RIFLES.Behind the men, lurching on unsteady feet, come A HALF-DOZEN OF THE LIVING DEAD, all wearing vests of white and blue.Behind the lumbering creatures come A WOMAN AND A MAN both wearing white laboratory coats and carrying clipboards. The woman is MARY HENRIED, one of the top behaviouralists in The Cave. (We'll learn a 
[DANGER][CONFLICT][MONSTER]lot more about her later.)THE ZOMBIES are pushing through the undergrowth right in the direction of SARAH and her friends. SARAH shows some alarm at this but JOHN calms her with a strong hand.SPIDER has seen the approaching danger. She silently draws A FARMER'S 
[CONFLICT][DANGER][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][PROBLEM][EXPOSITION][MONSTER]SICKLE from her belt. (With her other hand she draws A PISTOL for good measure.) BILL McDERMOTT unarmed, nervously takes another swallow from his flask.THE ZOMBIES are getting closer. Too close for comfort.
[TRANSITION][ACTION][MONSTER]Finally, MARY HENRIED and THE OTHERS turn and disappear into the bunker. The last man down pulls the hatch shut.The moment the coast is clear, SPIDER AND JOHN jump up from cover. THE OTHERS follow their lead. But it's too late. THE ZOMBIES have 
[CONFLICT][ACTION][TRANSITION][DANGER][METAPHOR][WEAPON][VAMPIRE]spotted them. The creatures begin to growl and make AGITATED, APE-LIKE SOUNDS. SPIDER brings her BLADE up chest-high, ready to repel an attack. SARAH lifts her own MACHETE but JOHN reaches over and takes it away from her.
[CONFLICT][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][ACTION][WEAPON][EXPOSITION][METAPHOR][PROBLEM][PERSPECTIVE][CHARACTERIZATION][EMOTION][SETTING][DANGER]JOHNGive that to me. Get behind me. Stay behind me.(SARAH resists, not understanding, somewhat insulted.)
[METAPHOR]You ain't wearin' a vest. They been taught not to touch the ones with the circles. There ain't no hundred percent, all-a-time rules with the Bees, but most-a-time they leave us alone. The colour on their vests tell ya how much schoolin' they got. It's 
[DANGER][METAPHOR][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][MONSTER]the ones without colours you gotta watch out for.SARAH gets behind JOHN, his orange circle acting as her shield. He reaches around with one strong arm and pulls her in tight against his back.THE ZOMBIES, snarling and showing teeth, move through the thicket. 
[TRANSITION][CONFLICT][ACTION][MONSTER]ONE shuffles right past SPIDER AND McDERMOTT. It gets stuck in the bramble, changes course and moves on without attacking.ANOTHER ZOMBIE, a [DIALOGUE]"white", trudges within arm's reach of JOHN, growling all the while. Suddenly it reaches its arms out and takes two angry steps towards the humans who back away.
[CONFLICT][EMOTION][ACTION][TRANSITION][METAPHOR][DANGER][WEAPON][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][CHARACTER][GHOST]THE ZOMBIES charges. Things happen quickly. JOHN pushes SARAH away and swings the MACHETE. THE BLADE SINKS INTO THE CREATURES SKULL. 
[TRANSITION][ACTION][WEAPON][CONFLICT][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE][VAMPIRE]BLACKENED BLOOD FLIES. An instant later SPIDER'S SICKLE PUNCHES IN BESIDE THE BIG KNIFE. THE ZOMBIE twitches for a moment, its eyes rolling, then it falls, lifeless, to the ground.McDERMOTT trots up beside SARAH. He takes a huge swallow from his 
[SURPRISE][METAPHOR][CHARACTERIZATION][MONSTER]flask then offers some to her. She puts the flask to her lips but nothing comes. She holds it out, neck down, to show that it's empty.McDERMOTTSorry. Guess I don't know my own strength.
[CONFLICT][WEAPON][HORROR]JOHN wipes SARAH'S MACHETE on some thick leaves, cleaning off most of the gore, then he returns the weapon to the woman.SARAHThanks. I can fight my own battles.JOHNI know you can. Like I said, we been 
[PROBLEM][CONFLICT][MONSTER]watchin' you.McDERMOTTWe better get as far away from here as we can. We can work the other side of the island tonight.JOHN(explaining) We found nine entrances to the Cave so far, and we ain't got the whole thing near charted yet. That's what we was 
[DANGER][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][CONTEXT][PERSPECTIVE][CHARACTER][CHARACTERIZATION][MONSTER]doin' out here today. Huntin' for entrances.McDERMOTTCome on. They find a Bee done like this and they'll know somebody's been out walkin' where they shouldn't have been.
[CHARACTER][SURPRISE][VAMPIRE]JOHN bows his head over the downed ZOMBIE. He mumbles softly. We can't hear the words but we can tell that he's praying, reciting the good words over the corpse of the [DIALOGUE]"white-coat".SARAHThe man I was with...until today... 
[METAPHOR][PROBLEM]believed that praying was for blind men who couldn't see the truth.JOHNHow we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two.SARAHCurse?JOHNWhat is it if it ain't a curse?
[DANGER][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][VAMPIRE]SARAHIt's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite 
[SURPRISE][PROBLEM][DANGER][METAPHOR][CONFLICT][HORROR]that infects the brain.JOHNThat sounds like a curse to me.SARAHWe thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. 
[DANGER][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][ACTION][HORROR]Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet!JOHNI'm sure that's true, miss. And that's why we're doin' what we're doin'. What's 
[CONFLICT][METAPHOR][DANGER][PROBLEM][GHOST]happenin' underground here is just what Lucifer planned for this sinful race o' man. But we're gonna beat Lucifer. We're gonna put an end to what's happenin' here.SARAHOh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus 
[DANGER][CONFLICT][WEAPON][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][ACTION][MONSTER]nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch.JOHNThat's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have

[TRANSITION][METAPHOR][PROBLEM][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE][ACTION]JOHNYou think you can find your boat? There's a thousand little inlets and backwaters all through here. You remember all the ways you turned to get where you are now? You leave yourself a trail?
[SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][SUSPENSE][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][MONSTER]SARAH is stopped by this. She stares at the big man suspiciously, not sure whether to believe him.JOHNWe didn't see the exact spot but we know about where you landed. But we ain't ready to take you there. Not yet. You see...we 
[SURPRISE][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][FLASHBACK][PERSPECTIVE][EMOTION][METAPHOR][ACTION]need guns, too.SARAH looks around her at the unlikely band of guerillas. She thinks for a moment...not very long...then she turns and starts off into the 
[SURPRISE][DANGER][METAPHOR]jungle.SARAHI can find it myself. I didn't come that far.JOHNFarther than you think. You'll get lost. 
[METAPHOR][CHARACTERIZATION][EXPOSITION][CONTEXT][SURPRISE]You will. And there's Bees all through the jungle. I ain't lyin' to ya. Religiosos don't lie.

[CONFLICT][DANGER][PROBLEM][ACTION][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][MONSTER]SARAH plunges into the brush and without so much as a look back over her shoulder she disappears.McDERMOTTWe can't let her go, John.JOHNWe don't need her guns that bad. Billy boy. 
[SURPRISE][METAPHOR][CHARACTERIZATION][CONFLICT][DANGER][PLOT][SETTING][DEATH][PROBLEM][SUSPENSE][FLASHBACK][CHARACTER][MONSTER](He's joking.)McDERMOTTThe hell we don't! But that's not what I mean. She'll be dead in ten minutes out there alone. That or she'll be firin' off

[CONFLICT][DANGER]Rhodes might have extra guards on after all the commotion. We'll meet up at number six and go back home together.McDERMOTTGod save us. And me with me flask dry. I'll never make it.
[TRANSITION][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][CONTEXT][CHARACTERIZATION]THE GROUP splits up, moving off in two different directions through the darkening underbrush.78	EXT. SOMEWHERE IN THE JUNGLE - NIGHTDARKNESS has fallen. The jungle is as black as the background on a velvet painting.
[TRANSITION][ACTION][CHARACTER]SARAH is moving cautiously. She bumps into something, jumps back, her MACHETE high, and freezes. Cautiously she moves ahead...one 
step...another...another...
[ACTION][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][DANGER][CLIMAX][EXPOSITION][METAPHOR][PROBLEM][CHARACTER][CONFLICT]SPLASH!!! She steps down off a hidden ledge into A KNEE-DEEP RIVER. 
[TRANSITION]She manages to keep her balance but her MACHETE falls into the water and drops to the bottom invisible in the dark silt. Slowly she bends down and reaches into the water. A SNAKE swims past just inches away. SARAH recoils. Before she can reach down again she hears A LOUD, 
[TRANSITION][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE]ANIMAL SNORT followed by A GREAT SPLASHING SOUND. Then ANOTHER. She squints to see.SHAPES approach on the black water. ALLIGATORS, big ones, just their 
[TRANSITION][ACTION][EMOTION][PERSPECTIVE][CONFLICT][EXPOSITION][MONSTER]very tops showing as they move on a straight course toward the woman.She backs up feeling for the shore, for the ledge behind her. THE FIRST ZOMBIE GRABS HER SHOULDERS. She spins and sees the thing. It 
[CONFLICT][FLASHBACK][ACTION][WEAPON][METAPHOR][PROBLEM]has one eye dangling out of its socket and there's a broken-off length of wooden pole stuck clean through its torso just under the left breast.SARAH smashes her RIFLE BUTT INTO THE THING'S HEAD. AGAIN. AGAIN. It 
[ACTION][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][FLASHBACK][WEAPON][METAPHOR][VAMPIRE]keeps coming. (So do the gators. They're getting to within a few yards.) SARAH swings a fourth time. THE ZOMBIE grabs her rifle. She 
[CONFLICT][ACTION][TRANSITION][EMOTION][DANGER][PROBLEM][MONSTER]pulls with all her might and the creature, hanging on to the gun, topples off the ledge and into the water.When SARAH starts to climb up on the ledge, ANOTHER ZOMBIE lurches towards her from dry land. She spins around, looking for options. The gators are just about close enough to bite her ass and THE ZOMBIE that fell into the river is rising up again, covered with moss and slime and looking pissed.
[WEAPON][DANGER][ACTION][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][MONSTER]SARAH faces THE ZOMBIE on the bank. She has no choice. She aims her AUTOMATIC. She's just about to fire when SOMETHING FLASHES out of the darkness. It's A MACHETE. IT CLEAVES OPEN THE ZOMBIE'S SKULL. From 
[CONFLICT][DANGER][METAPHOR][ACTION][EMOTION][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][WEAPON][MONSTER]out of the night big JOHN appears. He struggles to free his blade from the dead creature's head.SARAH scrambles up onto the muddy ledge. THE GATORS are still moving in and THE ZOMBIE, its moss-covered arms reaching out rigidly like the arms of Frankenstein's monster, is growling ferociously (almost swallowing its own dangling eyeball in the process).
[TRANSITION][MURDER]SARAHAre you gonna pause to say words over the dead this time or can we be on our way?Without answering, JOHN steams off through the bush pulling SARAH along behind him, his big hand tight around her arm.79	INT. THE CAVE - NIGHTCLOSE on: A TELEVISION SCREEN. First there is only VIDEO NOISE, then 
[MONSTER]an image blinks onto the screen.MONTAGE: OTHER VIDEO SCREENS on MONITORS in various places throughout the huge underground facility. ZOMBIES watch the screens gathered in groups of four, six and eight, like children in ranked classes.The screens show scenes of ZOMBIES taking FOOD from humans in ORANGE CIRCLE VESTS. GUNS are pointed at ORANGE CIRCLES then lowered 
[WEAPON][FLASHBACK][TRANSITION][METAPHOR][CONTEXT]harmlessly. GUNS are pointed at HUMANS without orange circles and FIRED. The images repeat and repeat and repeat. THE ZOMBIES watch the scenes with dumb curiosity.
80	INT. COMMUNICATION CENTER IN THE CAVE - NIGHTThis is the central area for all varieties of communication. There are RADIO CONSOLES, both intercom and outgoing, there are VIDEO CONTROL PANELS and there are LARGE COMPUTER TERMINALS. Reflecting the panic to set up operations back when the disaster first struck, much of the equipment is placed haphazardly and not built in. WIRES run 
every which way, BARE ANTENNAS AND LOOSE CONNECTORS clutter the place. ENGINEERS scurry with TOOL BOXES constantly repairing, patching, trouble shooting.Most of the personnel are TECHNICIANS but there is a group of SCIENTIFIC TYPES, obvious in their white lab coats. Among these is MARY HENRIED, who we caught a glimpse of outside Entrance Two.
[ACTION][DANGER][METAPHOR][CONTEXT][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][GORE]At A SECURITY STATION, A GUARD notices something on one of his own VIDEO SCREENS which monitor key locations inside The Cave.GUARDThere's activity in the dormitory!MARY and one of her assistants, JULIE GRANT, a younger girl, move over to the video console. ONE SCREEN there shows what looks like a prison corridor. CELLS WITH HEAVILY BARRED DOORS run down both sides. 
[TRANSITION][METAPHOR][ACTION][CHARACTERIZATION][CONTEXT][GHOST]We can see the distinct MOVEMENT OF SHADOWS in the corridor. MARY reacts instantly stepping over to AN INTERCOM and pressing A SEND-BUTTON.VOICE (o.s. - filter)

[DEATH][METAPHOR][MURDER]81	INT. THE DORMITORY IN THE CAVE - NIGHTCLOSE ON: THE MOUTH OF A LARGE PLASTIC BAG. A HAND wearing A BLACK LEATHER GLOVE pulls A HUMAN HEAD out of a bag by its hair. It's the head of one of the dead soldiers from Rhode's platoon. The hand 
[PROBLEM][CONFLICT][CHARACTER][DANGER][GHOST]belongs to RHODES himself.In the darkness of A CELL, A RED COAT ZOMBIES takes a hesitant step forward. RHODES tries to shove THE HEAD through the bars but IT STICKS. When RHODES lets go it stays there, wedged at shoulder height.
[SURPRISE][RELIEF][PERSPECTIVE][TRANSITION][ACTION][RESOLUTION][EXPOSITION][EMOTION][CONTEXT][HORROR]RHODESTake it, friend. Take it. It's a present. From me to you.
[MONSTER]THE RED COAT steps forward and lays its hand on THE HEAD.RHODESJust remember who gives you favours.THE ZOMBIE pulls hard and THE HEAD pops through onto its side of the bars. The creature lurches off towards A COT in the shadows at the rear of the cell where it hunkers down and begins to RAVISH THE HEAD, TEARING FLESH OFF, EATING IT hungrily.
[CONFLICT][TRANSITION]On the cell door we notice A PLAQUE with a number (5) and, written in marker, the Red Coat's nickname, [DIALOGUE]"BLUTO".RHODES moves past OTHER CELLS, each holding A NICKNAMED RED COAT. GRUMPY stands way back in the shadows. TONTO stands near the bars, growling. FATSO is swaying back and forth like a chubby five year old 
[METAPHOR][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][CHARACTER][PERSPECTIVE][MONSTER]who needs to pee.RHODES stops at A CELL marked [DIALOGUE]"BUB!". Inside we see A SILHOUETTE, tall, erect, not moving a muscle. RHODES grins.
[EMOTION][DANGER][CONFLICT]RHODESWell, Bub. I've heard about you. Miss Henried's pride and joy.RHODES steps closer and BUB snarls warningly.
[SURPRISE][METAPHOR][CHARACTER][PROBLEM][CHARACTERIZATION][CONFLICT][DANGER][HORROR]RHODESSurly sonofabitch. I want to make friends, Bub. Friends. I have one more goodie in my sack here.
[TRANSITION][SURPRISE][HAUNTED HOUSE]A LOUD, CLANGING SOUND interrupts. RHODES turns to see.82	INT. THE DORMITORY - NIGHTMARY HENRIED AND JULIE GRANT have entered through A STEEL DOOR WITH ELECTRONIC LOCKS. THE ZOMBIES send up A CHORUS OF MOANS AND GROWLS. 
[SURPRISE][DANGER][PROBLEM][HORROR]The women start down the corridor checking cells as they pass. Suddenly they stop in their tracks, their horrified eyes staring into A CELL marked [DIALOGUE]"SAMSON!".SAMSON is nibbling on ANOTHER HEAD. Much of the flesh is already gone, but we can still recognise...CHICO. The zombie turns the thing 
[CONFLICT][TRANSITION][HORROR]up-side-down, reaches way inside, through the neck, and pulls out grey matter.JULIE backs away, fighting nausea. A spasm rises in MARY'S stomach as well and she reels away from the hideous sight.RHODESCome, come, Miss Science. You've seen 
[PROBLEM][CONFLICT][DANGER]worse.MARYGod....damn you, Rhodes!
[CONFLICT][DANGER][PROBLEM][GHOST]RHODESGod has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours?MARYYou have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
[SURPRISE][PROBLEM][METAPHOR][CONTEXT][CHARACTERIZATION][PERSPECTIVE][HORROR]RHODESNo wonder they're so....hungry.
[EMOTION][ACTION][PROBLEM][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][APOCALYPSE]Suddenly JULIE SCREAMS, her hands flying to her mouth.THE PLASTIC BAG is still dangling from RHODES' GLOVED HAND. Inside, pressed into the thin plastic, we can see the rough outline of THE FINAL HEAD. THE THING IS SQUIRMING causing the whole bag to wiggle.
[TRANSITION][ACTION][SETTING][GHOST]RHODES drops the bag instantly to the floor. Taking care, he grabs the bottom by a loose corner and pulls up hard. THE HEAD ROLLS OUT AND SETTLES AGAINST A WALL. IT'S EYES ARE OPEN AND DARTING CRAZILY, ITS MOUTH IS CHEWING, GROTESQUELY, ON THE AIR.
[SURPRISE][CONFLICT]MARY stares in shock. JULIE runs towards the exit, trying to scream but gagging on her own acids. She's hysterical.RHODES calmly draws his PISTOL, cocks, and FIRES. THE SQUIRMING HEAD

[PERSPECTIVE][METAPHOR][WEAPON][RESOLUTION][DEATH][HORROR]RHODESThe purpose of decapitation is to preserve as much...food...as possible. The purpose 
[PERSPECTIVE][METAPHOR]for feeding is to keep the beasts on our side. The fact that they can be taught to clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a convenient side benefit, not the primary goal. The primary goal is to keep ourselves from becoming their supper. Keep them fed and they behave. Keep them hungry and they 
[FLASHBACK][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][CHARACTERIZATION][METAPHOR][PROBLEM][HORROR]revert back to being the animals that they have always been. You saw them in there.MARYYou gave them a fresh taste of blood!RHODESThey will never be satisfied with anything else, Miss Henried. They want human flesh.

[CONFLICT][PROBLEM][SURPRISE]A bubble of fear pushes up in MARY'S throat but she is only letting her anger show. Her stare is fierce, her eyes daggers.RHODESI had an unfortunate little run-in with him today. In fact...you might say that Mr.

[SURPRISE]86	INT. THE CENTRAL CHAMBERS OF THE CAVE - NIGHTMONTAGE: as MARY walks through HUGE OPEN AREAS CARVED OUT OF NATURAL ROCK. We are stunned at the enormity of the place. JEEPS AND TRUCKS RUMBLE back and forth. Storage areas hold MOUNTAINS OF CRATES,

[SURPRISE][DANGER]MARY stops in her tracks when she sees that outside A DOOR NUMBERED 83 (the door to her quarters) there are TWO OF RHODES' SOLDIERS with RIFLES in hand. The door itself is open and SHADOWS move inside.MARY turns quickly, before she is spotted, and starts back through the hallway. As she turns a corner she is grabbed by TOBY TYLER.

At his back, in the hut, A HAIRY FAT MAN, still wearing his boxer shorts and his muddy boots, is wham-bam-bamming A WHORE, who is wearing everything but underwear and boots. There are needle tracks on the woman's arms and her face looks as though she's been beaten brutally. She purses her deep red, damaged

[CONFLICT][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][CHARACTER][PROBLEM][MONSTER]MARY extends her right hand to meet BLUTO'S right and they shake vigorously. Then the dumb creature drops his arms and looks around. His brain sends no signal as to what he should do next. THE GUARDS lead him away.

(He was the one Rhodes referred to last night as [DIALOGUE]"Mary's pride and joy".) He is wearing WESTERN-STYLE GUN BELTS, SIX-SHOOTER hang in HOLSTERS on both his hips. MARY faces BUB full with her body and delivers a military

He's a fat man with a handlebar moustache that makes him look like Pancho Villa. As an indication of rank we wears a military jacket but underneath is a Hawaiian shirt with a bold flamingo and palm tree pattern. Around his neck, nestled 
[METAPHOR][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][PERSPECTIVE][CHARACTERIZATION][CONTEXT][MURDER]in the rolls of fat there, is enough gold to stake a small business.PROSECUTORI can only suggest that the court rule in favour of the ultimate penalty for this traitor.GASPARILLAYou always recommend the ultimate penalty, Tommy Lee.
