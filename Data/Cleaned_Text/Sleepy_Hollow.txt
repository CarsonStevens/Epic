ICHABOD               Our first night watch is adequate               against fire and some violence,               but if we were more often able to               ensure justice, after the fact,               then criminals would truly have               something to fear from law               enforcement.

HIGH CONSTABLE               And, with disrespect, Constable,               if jails and courts overflow, it is               testimony to success, not failure.

And, how many victims are buried               without reprisal while guilty men               roam our streets?     The High Constable reaches a desk, taking a seat.

[PROBLEM]                             HIGH CONSTABLE               Very few, if any.                             ICHABOD               Even though I have seen confessions               pried from the lips of the accused,               often quite literally?                             HIGH CONSTABLE               For one who calls himself a               Federalist, your mouth reeks of               Republican liberalism.

[EMOTION][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][METAPHOR]     The Magistrate WHISPERS in the High Constable's ear.  Ichabod     notices with worry that Constables One and Two wheel the     corpse onwards into another room.     The Magistrate finishes.  The High Constable smiles faintly.

[METAPHOR][TRANSITION][EMOTION][FLASHBACK][PERSPECTIVE]               Such a day for such a sad farewell.               But, this is goodbye, my sweet.     At the window, Ichabod holds a bird cage with a red CARDINAL     inside.  He opens the cage.  The bird flies free.
[METAPHOR][TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][CHARACTERIZATION][FLASHBACK][CHARACTER][CONTEXT]     Ichabod watches it go, then looks down.  A COACH halts in the     street below.  The forlorn DRIVER looks up.     INT.  ICHABOD'S COACH -- DAY
[SURPRISE][ACTION]     In motion.  Ichabod absently studies his hands, touching the     strange SCARS on both palms: evenly dispersed, tiny dots of     tissue.  Many scars.     Ichabod lifts a LEATHER SATCHEL, checking its contents.
[CONFLICT][TRANSITION][EMOTION][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][CONTEXT][FLASHBACK][PERSPECTIVE]     EXT.  UPSTATE FORESTS -- DAY     TWO FAMILIES of MIGRANT WORKERS travel a path, leading over-     burdened horses.  Ichabod's coach approaches from the other     direction.  Ichabod looks out, unnerved.

     MANY CHILDREN, in a circle, taunt a BLINDFOLDED YOUNG WOMAN     spun round by the handsome, barrel-chested man, BROM VAN     BRUNT.  A few YOUNG MEN and LADIES watch.  Brom releases the     woman.  Everyone quiets and avoids her searching hands.

Some believe a               person in this very town kneels               before Lucifer, offering death as               tribute.

BEHIND, in motion, WE SEE Daredevil's snorting visage; eyes     lizard-like, with vertical slits literally aglow.     The Horseman's hand yanks a wooden WAR HAMMER from a saddle     mount.

[SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][ACTION]     Ichabod rises, walks, studying the ground, kicking up leaves.     Brom, Van Ripper, Baltus and Philipse watch.     Ichabod finds a deep hoofprint.  Huge.  He compares the

[DANGER][PROBLEM][PERSPECTIVE][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][CHARACTER][CONFLICT][DEATH][MURDER]               you just laid eyes on our murderer               through that glass.

[EMOTION][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][PROBLEM][VAMPIRE]     DINING ROOM, Van Ripper rises, ill.  His wife questions his     health, but he holds her off and vomits.     Ichabod notes this with a deep sigh.     EXT.  VAN TASSEL ORCHARD -- EARLY EVENING
[METAPHOR][ACTION][CONFLICT][EMOTION][PROBLEM][HORROR]     Ocher dusk.  Ichabod rides to Young Masbath, seated on the     ground, miserable.  Young Masbath does not look up.                             ICHABOD                Find yourself a place in the servants'               residence and wake me before dawn.
[SURPRISE][PROBLEM][DANGER][METAPHOR][CONFLICT][SETTING][EXPOSITION][CHARACTERIZATION][TRANSITION][HORROR]               Our first task will be an unsavory one.     Ichabod rides.  Young Masbath runs to his horse and follows.     EXT. CHURCHYARD AND CEMETERY -- DAWN
[DANGER][PROBLEM][FLASHBACK][CONFLICT][EMOTION][MURDER]     Steenwyck is on horseback, looking down at Ichabod, furious.                             FATHER STEENWYCK                It is sacrilege!                             ICHABOD                I cannot proceed without examining               the previous victims.     Steenwyck looks to men with shovels.  Killian's there.
[CONFLICT][PROBLEM][DANGER][SURPRISE][COMEDIC HORROR]     Philipse, hung-over, stands beside Young Masbath.                             FATHER STEENWYCK                Magistrate Philipse, surely you can               stop this.     Philipse just looks up with a helpless expression.                             FATHER STEENWYCK                I will not allow it.  I will not!
[CONFLICT][SURPRISE][WITCH]                             ICHABOD                Protest to my superiors if you like.                             FATHER STEENWYCK               Your superiors are two days away!                             ICHABOD                Then, you should have left two days               ago, because I have men willing to               help me today.     Ichabod motions.  Killian leads the men to the graveyard.
[EMOTION][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][FLASHBACK]     Steenwyck watches, enraged.  He kicks his horse and rides.     Philipse looks worried.     EXT.  CHURCHYARD AND CEMETERY -- LATER MORNING (TIME CUT)
     A PSALM is HEARD READ by STEENWYCK O.S. while a coffin is     exhumed.  Ichabod guides the lifting.  The coffin is put near
[METAPHOR][TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][RELIEF][SURPRISE][CHARACTERIZATION]     the headstone [DIALOGUE]"WINDSOR."  Ichabod looks...     At the church, Steenwyck faces about fifty people who now     take up the PRAYER.
[ACTION]     Across the cemetery, two coffins, one small, one large, are     pried open.  [DIALOGUE]"VAN GARRETT, 1799."  Killian leads the effort     with Young Masbath's aid...
[SURPRISE][EMOTION][TRANSITION][ACTION][PERSPECTIVE][CHARACTER][CONFLICT][EXPOSITION][DANGER]     The lids come off, revealing the HEADLESS BODIES of a MAN and     a little BOY.  Young Masbath backs away.     At the [DIALOGUE]"WINDSOR" coffin, nails creak as Ichabod opens the     lid.  WE DO NOT SEE inside, but when Ichabod does, he is     aghast.  He looks to the men, angry.
[SURPRISE][CHARACTER][METAPHOR][WITCH]                             ICHABOD               Why was I not told of this?     No answer.  Killian arrives, nods solemnly.                             KILLIAN                The Widow Windsor.

Look at her.                             KILLIAN                It's not something people speak of               openly.  She did not remarry.
[TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][CONTEXT][WITCH]     Ichabod kneels, studying.  Now, WE SEE: the belly of the     headless corpse is bulbous, because the Widow Windsor was     very far along in a pregnancy.     Ichabod notices: a tear in the cloth of widow's blouse.  He     reaches through the tear, feeling the stomach.
[WEAPON][CONFLICT][ACTION][PROBLEM][DANGER][SURPRISE]     He straightens, greatly troubled.     INT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- MORNING     Scissors cut open the widow's blouse.  There's an inch-long     WOUND on the moldering belly; a sword puncture.
[CONFLICT][METAPHOR][DEATH][SURPRISE][MONSTER]     Ichabod examines the corpse on a table.  Lancaster watches,     anxiously mopping his face.  Young Masbath's in a corner.     Ichabod goes to write in his ledger full of notes.
[PROBLEM][SURPRISE][METAPHOR]                             ICHABOD                What is the common thread between               these victims?                             YOUNG MASBATH                I'm sure I don't know.                             ICHABOD                We must discover it.  The reason the               murderer chose these persons.     Ichabod goes to look at the widow's corpse, pondering.
[CHARACTERIZATION]                             ICHABOD                The wounds are the same.  Cauterized.               No chopping or half-measures either.               One stroke took the head.  Have you

[EMOTION][CHARACTER][TRANSITION][RELIEF][ACTION][PERSPECTIVE]     The boy, YOUNG ICHABOD, turns, smiling.  He runs.  We FOLLOW     to a clearing behind a frontier home.  MOTHER waits.  Lovely

[CHARACTER][TRANSITION][METAPHOR]     It's a piece of reed grass, woven into an elaborate pattern     with shafts of wheat twisted into the center.  Young Ichabod     replaces it, closes the drawer.     ICHABOD'S DREAM -- MARKET SQUARE -- DAY     A busy, muddy street lined by wares and produce.  Young     Ichabod walks with FATHER, an emotionless man.  Father stops

     Ichabod enters with a lantern and his ledger.  He sits,     studies notes, then notices there's a light down the hall.     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SEWING ROOM -- NIGHT     Opposite an elaborate loom, Katrina reads by candlelight.
[SURPRISE]     She looks up, seeing Ichabod enter.                             ICHABOD                Sorry for disturbing you.  I thought               a forgotten candle was burning.     Katrina self-consciously closes her shabby book, puts it with     another on her lap and covers them.
[SURPRISE][METAPHOR]                             KATRINA                You do not disturb me.  Please stay.               Having trouble sleeping?                             ICHABOD                May I ask... why do you cover your

[SURPRISE]                             ICHABOD                I, um... I have something to show you,               if you have a moment.

[SURPRISE][COMEDIC HORROR]     She takes his hand, spreads the fingers to the palm.  She     touches the many evenly spaced scars.                             KATRINA                These scars.  How did you get them?
[FLASHBACK][SURPRISE]                             ICHABOD                I have had them since childhood.  I               cannot remember what from.                             KATRINA                It would be interesting to find out.     Their eyes meet.  Ichabod gets back to the ledger.  Katrina
[METAPHOR][TRANSITION][CHARACTERIZATION][PERSPECTIVE][RELIEF][EXPOSITION][CONFLICT][CONTEXT]     seems to relish the effect she has.  Ichabod finds a paper     disk on string, illustrated thusly:                             ICHABOD                Here it is.  A bird on one side.               His cage on the other.  Now,

[SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][METAPHOR][EXPOSITION][CHARACTERIZATION][CONTEXT][TRANSITION][EMOTION][CHARACTER][PROBLEM]     Ichabod gives it.  She spins it, smiling.                             ICHABOD                He only appears to be inside the               cage.  The point being...

[METAPHOR][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][CONFLICT]               singular thrust found its target               omnipotently, as if the Horseman made               certain the unborn child died with               its mother.                             KATRINA                And this gives worth to butchery?                             ICHABOD                It was not butchery.                             KATRINA                What is it then?

ICHABOD                I have no solution for its meaning               yet, but I could not just ignore it.                             KATRINA                Take a lesson from Young Masbath's               desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows               with you to avenge his father's death.

KATRINA                You falter with your answer because               you strive without putting the whole               of your heart into it.  Can't you see?               You'll bring dignity to the dead even               if you have to chop them into little               pieces to do it.

[TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][METAPHOR][HAUNTED HOUSE]     INT.  CAVE HOME -- DAY     Ichabod and Young Masbath step in.     Walls are hung with skins and skeletons, dry flowers and reed     grass in patterns.  An OLD CRONE sits facing away.
[CHARACTER][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][TRANSITION][CONFLICT]     The old Crone, a mountain woman with matted hair and grey     features, sits disinterested.  Ichabod edges closer.                             ICHABOD               Pardon.  You did not answer when I               knocked.  Are we intruding?

[TRANSITION][CONFLICT]     Ichabod is afraid, backing away, but Young Masbath takes the     woven piece and steps to the Crone.                             YOUNG MASBATH               Were you a friend to the Indian?                     (waits)               You should have this... if you were

[TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][WEAPON]     The Old Crone reaches to pick up the weaving.  She stands,     faces them.  Tall.  Ichabod nods.

[METAPHOR][CONFLICT]     Ichabod sits on crooked stool.  The old Crone kneels with her     back to him, gathers straw in a pile on the floor.                             ICHABOD                Can you help?                             OLD CRONE                You want to see into the nether world...

Keep silent.     She takes two jars from a table, pours ashes on the pile from     one.  She shakes the other roughly, takes the lid off and     upends it.  A baby bat squirms on the floor, dazed.
[WEAPON][ACTION][EXPOSITION]     The Old Crone holds the bat, using a knife to cut off its     head.  She soaks the straw with blood, SPEAKING IN TONGUES,     guttural.  Using a wick, she lights the straw.     She grasps two METAL CUFFS with chains attached, slides these     onto her bony wrists, then bends to inhale smoke.

[TRANSITION]     She remains motionless.  The STORM outside intensifies.     WE SEE the skin of the Crone's wrists transform; swelling in     the cuffs, hardening, cracking and bleeding.     Some thing Ichabod cannot see.  He inches closer.

[TRANSITION][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][EMOTION][CHARACTER][ACTION][PROBLEM][EXPOSITION][SURPRISE][MONSTER]     Ichabod hits the floor, knocking over a table of bones.  The     creature is chained, but still wants Ichabod.  It SCREECHES.     The Old Crone's face seethes from transformation, eyes blood     red, nostrils dripping, teeth now jagged.

[CONFLICT][TRANSITION][SURPRISE]     Ichabod heads towards Young Masbath.  Baltus watches from the     porch, disgruntled.  He goes in.     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS -- DAY
[METAPHOR][CHARACTERIZATION][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][SETTING][PLOT][TRANSITION][PROBLEM][EXPOSITION][PERSPECTIVE]     Heavy rain.  Ichabod and Young Masbath ride side by side.                             YOUNG MASBATH                If the Crone's wound bled hard, that               means she was not killed by the               Hessian.  Someone only tried to make               it look that way.

Ichabod takes out his pistol and wades     into forest growth, backtracking.     INSIDE THE FOREST, Ichabod bounds through underbrush, low.  A

[EMOTION][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][EXPOSITION][DANGER]     Raining still.  Ichabod, Masbath and Katrina come into a     clearing, mouths falling open at the sight of...
[DEATH][DANGER][METAPHOR][CONFLICT][MONSTER]     A monstrously huge TREE OF THE DEAD, at the clearing's     center, with branches reaching far and wide, knotted and     gross, like agony captured in wood sculpture.     Ichabod dismounts, crossing a line beyond which grass and     weeds will not grow.  Young Masbath and Katrina dismount.                             YOUNG MASBATH               You were right... it does draw
[PERSPECTIVE][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][METAPHOR]               attention to itself.     Ichabod stares up into the endless, dead canopy of branches.     He circles the incredibly wide trunk.     There's a VERTICAL WOUND in the bark, as if the tree once had     a terrible vertical in it, now partially healed and     disgustingly scarred.  Ichabod approaches.
[PROBLEM][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][MURDER]     He feels the mushy scar, picking at its scabs till much sap     begins to trickle. It is red and Ichabod fingers it.                             ICHABOD               Blood.                             KATRINA               What did you say?
[SURPRISE]     Ichabod goes to where Katrina and Masbath wait with the     horses, digs in a saddle bag for a hand axe.                             YOUNG MASBATH               What is it?                             ICHABOD               Stay back.     At the trunk, Ichabod thumps the flat end of the axe against     the suture.  It sounds hollow.  Ichabod begins to chop.
[CONFLICT][ACTION][WEAPON][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][DANGER][METAPHOR]     He pulls away loose bark.  The tree drips more blood and a     clear goo.  Ichabod uses both hands on the axe to hack at the     festering suture.                             KATRINA               What are you doing?
[PERSPECTIVE][ACTION][METAPHOR][CHARACTERIZATION][RESOLUTION]                             ICHABOD               Just... keep where you are.
[TRANSITION][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][WEAPON][ACTION][METAPHOR]     Ignoring, Young Masbath moves closer.  Ichabod keeps     chopping, then grips a large, loose flap of wood, trying to     bend it.  It's not easy.  Ichabod struggles.
[SURPRISE][CONFLICT][EXPOSITION][TRANSITION][ACTION][PROBLEM][METAPHOR][WEAPON][PERSPECTIVE][RESOLUTION][DANGER][CONTEXT][FLASHBACK]     Katrina follows Masbath's slow advance.     Ichabod's pulling... the flap suddenly gives, revealing a
[CHARACTER][MONSTER]     blood-soaked, wide-eyed, gap-mouthed HUMAN HEAD.     Ichabod recoils.  Behind him, Katrina stifles a scream,     taking Young Masbath in her arms to keep him from looking.     It is Philipse's head, hanging off the trunk flap, held by     roots grown around and into the flesh.
[SURPRISE][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][FLASHBACK][PROBLEM][HORROR]     Ichabod reapproaches, back of his hand to his mouth.     FOUR other SEVERED, DECAYING HEADS are held by ingrown roots     within the dewy innards.                             KATRINA                My God... what has happened?

ICHABOD                Why this tree?     Ichabod begins looking at the ground, moving around the tree.     He gets to his knees, pushing mud away.

The     blast has blown apart his uniform at the chest and shoulder,     exposing rotten flesh and maggot-infested muscle.     Brom readies his ramrod, jamming powder in the barrel.

Brom grabs SCYTHES with long

[CONFLICT][ACTION][TRANSITION][WEAPON][DANGER][EXPOSITION][MONSTER]     Ichabod moves to the side, looking for an opening.  He swings     the sickle. The Horseman blocks.     The Horseman battles both at once, catching blows...
[CONFLICT][ACTION][WEAPON]     countering every strike, METAL RINGING.     Brom catches the Horseman's sword in one scythe, holding it     off.  Catches the axe handle in the other scythe.     The Horseman flatfoot KICKS Brom's chest, sending him down.
[WEAPON][ACTION][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][TRANSITION][METAPHOR]     Ichabod swings the sickle blade...     Hits the Horseman, the blade embedding to the hilt.

[TRANSITION][FLASHBACK][PERSPECTIVE][SURPRISE][WEAPON][CONFLICT][MONSTER]     Brom looks back.  No Horseman.  He leaves the scythe and     moves to the front, hefting another pole to help guide.                             BROM               Let's see him catch us now.

ICHABOD                To discover what might have been taken               from those who died, it will help to               know what was there that could be               taken in the first place.     Ichabod waits.  After a moment, he looks uncertain.  He
[TRANSITION][CONTEXT][ACTION][PERSPECTIVE][PROBLEM]     crosses to the half-open door...     INT.  NOTARY PUBLIC, RECORDS ROOM -- DAY
[SURPRISE][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][EMOTION][TRANSITION][METAPHOR][HORROR]     Ichabod sticks his head in, not liking what he sees.     Hardenbrook's amidst unbelievable disarray.  Tables, shelves,     and baskets of unevenly piled documents.     Hardenbrook looks on a shelf, confused, then goes to a table,     lifting papers, mumbling.
[PROBLEM][DANGER][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][HORROR]                             HARDENBROOK                Damn... damn... damn...

                             ICHABOD                Perhaps, I could assist in finding them?                             HARDENBROOK               Well... that might be... helpful.
[FLASHBACK]     INT.  NOTARY PUBLIC, RECORDS ROOM (TIME CUT) -- DAY     Hardenbrook is asleep in a chair, snoring, blind eye open.     Ichabod and Young Masbath face official-looking documents,     with Ichabod focused on one will in hand.                             YOUNG MASBATH                My father had farm land.  It was the
[WEAPON][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE][CHARACTER][CHARACTERIZATION][METAPHOR][CONFLICT][CONTEXT][PERSPECTIVE][EXPOSITION][PROBLEM][GHOST]               only thing we owned of any value.                             ICHABOD                     (still reading)                And it now belongs to you, according               to Baltus.  I heard him say it.                             YOUNG MASBATH                Yes.
     Ichabod turns the will in his hand to Masbath.                             ICHABOD                Then look here at your father's will,               and tell me why you are not listed.     Young Masbath takes it, boggled.  Ichabod grabs another.
[METAPHOR][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][DEATH][CONTEXT][PERSPECTIVE][CHARACTERIZATION][CHARACTER][MURDER]                             ICHABOD                Van Garrett had denoted his elder son               in his last wishes; the same son               murdered along with him.  But Van               Garrett's wife and two infant children               are not written... and they were spared.
[SURPRISE][PROBLEM][METAPHOR][FLASHBACK][EXPOSITION][CONTEXT][PERSPECTIVE][CONFLICT]                     (picks up another will)               Do you see?  Philipse had no family to               bestow his farm to.  But, here...
[CONFLICT][DANGER][PROBLEM]                     (picks up another)                The Widow Windsor was listed on her               late husband's will.  After her               inheritance, she amended the document               to include her bastard child.  This is               why the Horseman made absolutely               certain to impale the unborn descendant.     Ichabod sits back.

YOUNG MASBATH                But, if the farm is not mine, who stole               it away?                             ICHABOD                No one yet, far as I can tell.  It has

[DEATH][PROBLEM]                             ICHABOD                Often in such cases, property which               has gone intestate legally passes to               whomever the deceased was indebted to.

Ichabod stands, grim, gathering wills and his ledger.                             ICHABOD                Tonight, we answer questions.  And, to

[SURPRISE]     A LOUD NOISE is HEARD from the other room.  Ichabod looks.     INT.  HARDENBROOK'S OFFICES -- DAY     Ichabod bursts in.  No one there.  A chair has been knocked
[ACTION][TRANSITION][METAPHOR][MONSTER]     over and the front door is ajar.  Ichabod moves...
[CONFLICT][TRANSITION][METAPHOR][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK][CHARACTERIZATION][ACTION][EXPOSITION][CONTEXT][PERSPECTIVE][CHARACTER][PROBLEM]     EXT.  NOTARY -- DAY     Ichabod exits.  All around is the commotion in the square as     before.  No telling who it was who just fled.
     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- DAY     Young Masbath is seated, bored.  Ichabod writes in his     ledger.  A KNOCK on the door.  They both look up.
[SURPRISE][EMOTION][CONFLICT][TRANSITION]                             KATRINA (o.s.)                     (from outside door)               Constable... are you there?
[SURPRISE][PROBLEM]                     (long pause)               Ichabod?     The knob is tried and found locked.  Pause.  At the bottom of     the door, a red rose is passed under.
[METAPHOR][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][EMOTION][PERSPECTIVE][HAUNTED HOUSE]     This saddens Ichabod.     EXT.  CHURCH -- NIGHT     Quiet night.  The church is a sight, with a yard resembling     an empty squatter's tent city, surrounded by crosses.
[TRANSITION][METAPHOR][PROBLEM][DANGER]     Boarded over windows leak shafts of light.     MOVING PAST THE WINDOWS: many eyes peer out from the slats.     UP IN THE BELFRY, TWO RIFLEMEN are on watch.     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT
[TRANSITION]     Ichabod and Masbath are in darkness, still waiting.  Ichabod     takes the cover off a lantern, looks at a clock.  Midnight,     straight up.  Ichabod stands, picks up an unlit candle.
[TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][CONTEXT][SETTING][METAPHOR]                             ICHABOD               Midnight seems an appropriate time.     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, HALLWAY -- NIGHT     Ichabod and Young Masbath look out, cautious.  They move to     the nearest door.
[TRANSITION][METAPHOR][CONFLICT]     Ichabod crouches, using the candle to mark the seam of the     door and door frame.  He's making a low, wax seal.  If the     door opens, the seal will break.     They move to a second door, quietly.  Ichabod makes another
     low wax mark.     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, MAIN ENTRANCE -- NIGHT     Ichabod and Masbath come downstairs to a hall.  Ichabod     continues his wax marking at each door.
     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, BALTUS' OFFICE -- NIGHT     Ichabod and Young Masbath enter, shutting the door.  Ichabod     walks to shelves at Baltus' desk, looks through ribbon bound     DOCUMENTS and hands some to Masbath.     Young Masbath pulls off the ribbon, pages through these [DIALOGUE]"LOAN     AGREEMENT" parchments.  Ichabod brings another pile.
[PROBLEM]                             ICHABOD                     (whispering)               They are alphabetical.     Young Masbath has the M's.

ICHABOD                     (regarding his documents)                There are none for Magistrate Philipse               either.  [DIALOGUE]"Paasch, James" [DIALOGUE]"Pieter,               Thomas" [DIALOGUE]"Pos, William."     A FLOORBOARD CREAKS.  Ichabod looks, blows out the lantern.
[TRANSITION][METAPHOR][CONFLICT][FLASHBACK]     He and Young Masbath stand frozen.     Across the room, light comes under the door, stops, then     continues.  A DOOR is HEARD OPENING and SHUTTING.  Ichabod     crosses to follow, pointing back.
[TRANSITION][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE]                             ICHABOD                Keep looking.  Then, hide in my room               and bolt the door till I return.     EXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT     Lantern light moves, far ahead.  Ichabod follows.
[TRANSITION][METAPHOR]     EXT.  FOREST, FURTHER ON -- NIGHT     Ichabod stops, hidden.  He can see the light ahead, but it is     no longer in motion.  He advances.
[METAPHOR][CONFLICT]     EXT.  FOREST CLEARING -- NIGHT     A lantern sits on a rock.  On a blanket, a semi-naked MAN and     semi-naked WOMAN are in the midst of rough SEX.     Ichabod crawls to peer from underbrush.
[TRANSITION][ACTION][CONFLICT][EMOTION][CHARACTER]     The couple keeps coupling, with the man on top.  His grunts     and gasps are particularly desperate.  He's all over the     woman, who lays back... it is Lady van Tassel.
[EXPOSITION][TRANSITION][WEAPON][CONFLICT][ACTION]     Ichabod swallows, inches closer.     Lady van Tassel pulls the man's shirt, exposes his flesh.     She raises a small, sharp KNIFE behind his back.     Ichabod's eyes widen.
[WEAPON][ACTION][EXPOSITION][EMOTION]     Lady Van Tassel brings the blade to her own hand, slicing     deep in her palm.  Blood flows.  She rubs her cut hand over     her partner's arching back, smearing blood.     Lady van Tassel caresses the man's chest, neck, face...
[EMOTION][ACTION][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][CHARACTER][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][METAPHOR]     trailing blood.  The man lifts his head, in ecstasy, sucks     the woman's bloody fingers... it's Clergyman Steenwyck.
     Ichabod backs away, having seen more than plenty.     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT     Young Masbath unlocks the door.  Ichabod enters.

ICHABOD                Lady Van Tassel.                             YOUNG MASBATH                What was she doing?

Did you find the               victims' loan agreements?                             YOUNG MASBATH                No.  They are all missing.
[PROBLEM][DANGER][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][SURPRISE][MONSTER]     This troubles Ichabod.                             YOUNG MASBATH                There is more, though.  While you were               gone, I could hear someone else               walking through the house.     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- NIGHT

[SURPRISE][TRANSITION][METAPHOR][MONSTER]     moves his lantern to make a quick search, goes to table.     He touches the top of a candle.  His finger comes away with a     bit of still wet wax.                             YOUNG MASBATH                There are no other doors.  This is as

ICHABOD                It is nothing.  She comes to read books,               so her father will not find her.                     (to convince himself)                It is absolutely nothing.

[SURPRISE][METAPHOR][PROBLEM][MONSTER]     Ichabod stops, looking around.  No books anywhere.                             YOUNG MASBATH                If there is a secret place for books...
[METAPHOR][PERSPECTIVE]               it could be just as good for the               missing loan agreements.     Ichabod ponders this without saying anything.     INT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SEWING ROOM -- LATER NIGHT     SEARCH MONTAGE:     - Drawers are opened and searched, quietly.
[METAPHOR]     - Young Masbath uses a candle to look up the fireplace.     - Ichabod opens a linen cabinet, unfolding blankets.     - Young Masbath looks in a closet filled with big spools of     sewing thread, on his knees, pulls a wooden box forward.     Inside it, he finds only old cups and silverware.
[TRANSITION][ACTION][EMOTION][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][FLASHBACK][CHARACTER]     Ichabod pulls up a rug, feeling along the floorboards.     Young Masbath crawls, doing the same.  He climbs under the     loom, tapping on the floor.  TAP... TAP... TAP...
[ACTION][TRANSITION][PLOT][CONFLICT]     He crawls further under the loom.  TAP... TAP... PLONK.  A

[SURPRISE]     Young Masbath reaches in up to his shoulder.  He comes up     with [DIALOGUE]"LOAN AGREEMENTS."                             YOUNG MASBATH                Fie!  Here they are.     Ichabod takes them.  Names are near the top: [DIALOGUE]"Masbath," "Van

[SURPRISE][TRANSITION][METAPHOR][FLASHBACK]                     (crossing to him)                You do have a background in the               medical arts, don't you, Constable?                             ICHABOD               Very little.  I must be going...
[EMOTION][GHOST]     Lady Van Tassel holds out her cut palm, the gash sewn shut.                             LADY VAN TASSEL               Will you look at this?  I cut my hand               this morning: I sewed it myself, but               I am afraid it will go bad.     Ichabod takes her hand, distracted and nervous.

[CONFLICT][EMOTION][DANGER][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][WITCH]     Ichabod tries to pull away, but she grips tighter.  The FRONT     DOOR is HEARD SLAMMING.  Ichabod is panicky.                             LADY VAN TASSEL                Have mercy on me.  Please... have mercy.
[TRANSITION][SURPRISE][METAPHOR]     Ichabod pulls away just as Baltus enters.  Lady Van Tassel     goes back to work as if nothing happened.                             BALTUS                Constable, it is urgent that we speak.     EXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE FRONT PORCH -- MORNING

I found them secreted               away in the sewing room.     Katrina's expression changes just so slightly to guilt.

[CONFLICT][EMOTION]     He stares at her.  Katrina stares back, in a small way     defeated.  She looks for an out, but there is none.                             KATRINA               I have been reading your journal.
[SURPRISE][FLASHBACK][CONTEXT][PROBLEM]               I'm sorry.  I found it too fascinating               to resist.

[ACTION][WEAPON][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][DANGER]     immediately points his pistol at Van Ripper.                             ICHABOD               Get down.  Hurry!     Van Ripper climbs off.  Ichabod climbs up, whips the horses.
[METAPHOR][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK]                             ICHABOD                Sorry.     Van Ripper watches the coach leave, still with his hands up.     EXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT     In a wooded area, Katrina lies unconscious.  Gloved hands
[EMOTION][METAPHOR]     reach to her hair and cut off a clump with SCISSORS.     A conjuring pile has been made, containing a small animal's     heart with an iron nail through it.  Katrina's hair is added     and the pile is lit to burn.     Nearby, Young Masbath watches, on his belly with his hands     tied behind his back.
     Lady Van Tassel whispers over the fire, her white horse tied     nearby.  She looks to Katrina, who stirs.     Lady Van Tassel takes the Horseman's skull from a bag over     her shoulder, places the skull in the flames.  THUNDER is     HEARD.  Lady Van Tassel looks up, smiles.
[TRANSITION][MURDER]     EXT.  WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- NIGHT     The wind tosses leaves in swirls.  The twisted tree opens     wide, with a RUMBLE -- shafts of light shooting out.     EXT.  THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- NIGHT
[CONFLICT][FLASHBACK][METAPHOR][PROBLEM]     Ichabod drives the coach hard ahead.     EXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT     Katrina sits up, groggy.  Lady Van Tassel looks down at her.

Katrina sees Young Masbath, and beyond him, the dying fire.                             YOUNG MASBATH                She commands the Horseman.
[TRANSITION][FLASHBACK]                             LADY VAN TASSEL                And, quite beautifully done, wouldn't               you say?  It is almost over.     THUNDER again.  Wind starts to pick up.

But, as long as               I govern the Horseman, he cannot harm               me.  Baltus did not stay enough to               see that.  He ran as a coward,

[FLASHBACK][DEATH][CONFLICT][DANGER][MURDER]                             LADY VAN TASSEL                The precious servant girl Sarah.

And, when I               return to the Hollow tomorrow, my               version of the truth will come to               pass.

Katrina cautiously moves the hand she's supporting herself     with, feels a rock and clutches it.                             LADY VAN TASSEL                Imagine my surprise, finding him on a               liason with a common servant.  A girl               who had apparently become his secret               love.

[ACTION][WEAPON][CONFLICT][DANGER][TRANSITION][PROBLEM]     Katrina slings the rock -- strikes Lady Van Tassel in the     head, a glancing blow that knocks her down.  Katrina runs.     Katrina grips Young Masbath, helping him up...
     But, Lady Van Tassel scrambles up, grabs Katrina and throws     her back to the ground.     Lady Van Tassel steps hard on Katrina's ankle, touches her     forehead, bleeding, pissed.                             LADY VAN TASSEL                You've been a naughty girl.     Young Masbath leaps to action, charging head first -- slams     into Lady Van Tassel, sends her backwards.

Behind, at the tree line, Lady Van Tassel holds up the     Horseman's skull, wind tossing her dress and hair.

[CONFLICT][TRANSITION][WEAPON][ACTION]     Reins in one hand and saw in the other, Ichabod waits.  The     Horseman rises up and moves in, taking out his sword.     Young Masbath climbs down to the wooden pole connecting the     coach to the bridles, puts out his hand.  Katrina takes it.
[ACTION][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][PERSPECTIVE][METAPHOR][WEAPON]     Behind, the Horseman swings.  Ichabod blocks with the saw.     Young Masbath guides Katrina as she leaps onto one horse.     Bareback.  Young Masbath straddles the horse beside her.
[CONFLICT][ACTION][DANGER][DEATH][WEAPON][TRANSITION][PROBLEM][CHARACTER][MURDER]     The Horseman swings, backhanded knocks the sword from     Ichabod's hand as Ichabod falls back...     Ichabod hits the bridle post, hanging onto straps for dear     life.  His feet drag on the trail.

[ACTION][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][DANGER]     The horses detach from the coach, dragging Ichabod along.     The coach careens out of control.     It flies off the trail, hits an incline and sails off,     throwing the Horseman.     The coach hits a tree trunk and SMASHES.
[CONFLICT][SURPRISE][SUSPENSE][EMOTION][DANGER][PERSPECTIVE]     FURTHER DOWN THE TRAIL, the coach horses stop.  Young Masbath     and Katrina climb off as Ichabod gets to his feet, hurting,     clutching his previously wounded shoulder.

[PROBLEM][METAPHOR][SURPRISE][DANGER][CONFLICT][ACTION][WEAPON][CHARACTERIZATION][MONSTER]     The door buckles.                             YOUNG MASBATH                It won't hold.     Ichabod goes to a large GRINDSTONE against a wall.  He     struggles to roll it.
[ACTION][TRANSITION][WEAPON][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][EXPOSITION]     Young Masbath helps him roll it to the trap door.  It falls     on top with a thud.  The Horseman's sword jabs up through the     grindstone's center hole.     The sword withdraws.  A POUNDING begins.

[CONFLICT][METAPHOR][CONTEXT]     Young Masbath back away.  Ichabod holds his lantern up,     desperate for ideas, searching.     Above, to the right, is the milling platform, where grain is     ground and bagged.  To the left is the crooked staircase.
[PLOT][PERSPECTIVE][SETTING][METAPHOR][TRANSITION][WEAPON][CONFLICT][EXPOSITION][ACTION][RESOLUTION][DANGER][CONTEXT][CHARACTERIZATION][HAUNTED HOUSE]     Ichabod picks up a bailing hook, a plan forming.  He gives     his lantern to Katrina and points.                             ICHABOD                Get up those stairs.  Open the door to               the roof and wait.
[TRANSITION][ACTION][WEAPON]     Katrina and Young Masbath obey.  Ichabod crosses and climbs     the ladder to the milling platform.  He grasps a wooden     lever, pulling it.  Gears above begin to turn.
[CONFLICT][WEAPON][TRANSITION][METAPHOR][FLASHBACK][EXPOSITION][PROBLEM][CONTEXT][ACTION]     EXT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT     The windmill's rotors CREAK to life, spinning.     UNDER THE WINDMILL, the Horseman keeps chopping.  His axe     exposes grindstone, throwing sparks.
[PERSPECTIVE][TRANSITION][FLASHBACK][WEAPON][METAPHOR][CONFLICT][CHARACTERIZATION]     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT     Katrina looks down from the stairs.     The Horseman's axe pries at the seam of the trap door.                             KATRINA               Ichabod...

[EMOTION]     Ichabod pulls bags of grain, lining them up at the edge of     the milling platform.                             ICHABOD                     (under his breath)                Hopefully.     ABOVE, Young Masbath reaches the ceiling, throws open the     door to the roof.     BELOW, Ichabod cuts holes into the grain bags, so milled     grain spills out and falls to the floor, creating dust.
[CONFLICT][METAPHOR][FLASHBACK][CONTEXT][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][CHARACTERIZATION][EXPOSITION][ACTION]     He grabs one open bag and dumps it.  More grain dust.     EXT.  WINDMILL ROOF -- NIGHT     Masbath and Katrina come out.  Rotors spin behind them.

[ACTION][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][WEAPON]     trying to push the grindstone aside, then withdrawing.  The     RACKING axe continues.  Won't be long.     Ichabod grabs one half-full bag of grain, swings it with     effort, throws...

[CONFLICT][TRANSITION][ACTION][METAPHOR][EXPOSITION][WEAPON][PROBLEM][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE][DANGER][CONTEXT][MONSTER]     Ichabod slices into a sack hanging from a pulley system.     More and more dust rises.     Below, the Horseman enters.  Katrina shouts from above.

The Horseman moves toward the ladder milling platform ladder,     but Ichabod grabs it, pulling it up...
[PROBLEM][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][DANGER][METAPHOR]     The Horseman just misses the final rung.     Ichabod throws the ladder aside as the Horseman backs off.     Ichabod looks to the staircase.  No way to climb down from     the milling platform and get there.
[ACTION][TRANSITION][EXPOSITION][CONTEXT][WEAPON][CHARACTER][MONSTER]     The Horseman runs and leaps, grabbing a hanging chain...     The Horseman climbs the chain, swinging...
[ACTION][TRANSITION][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][CONTEXT]     Ichabod runs across the platform, jumps...     Ichabod grasps the frail rail of the staircase, barely.
[CONFLICT][ACTION][DANGER][METAPHOR][PROBLEM][TRANSITION]     The rail creaks, about to break.  Behind, the Horseman lands     on the milling platform.     Ichabod is losing grip.  Young Masbath races down the stairs,     grabs his hand.  He pulls Ichabod up.
[WEAPON][EMOTION][ACTION][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][PROBLEM][PERSPECTIVE][DANGER][SURPRISE]     Ichabod's pistol slips from its holster and falls.     Ichabod and Young Masbath look...
[ACTION][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][DANGER][PROBLEM]     The Horseman, following Ichabod's lead, runs across the     milling platform and leaps...     Grabs the staircase rail, only a few feet from Ichabod and     Masbath.  Ichabod kicks the rail, breaking it...
[METAPHOR][CONFLICT][ACTION][FLASHBACK][DANGER][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][PROBLEM]     The Horseman falls in billowing dust, crashing below.     Ichabod pushes Masbath up the stairs.     EXT.  WINDMILL ROOF -- NIGHT     Katrina helps them onto the roof.

[ACTION][METAPHOR][TRANSITION][CHARACTER][CONTEXT]     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT     The Horseman runs, agile, up stairs.     EXT.  WINDMILL ROOF -- NIGHT     Ichabod shepherds Katrina and Young Masbath to the edge where     the rotors spin close.

Face front and wait for me.                             KATRINA                I... I can't do this.
[CONFLICT][TRANSITION][DANGER][SURPRISE][PROBLEM]                             ICHABOD                We have no choice.     Ichabod moves back to the trap door.     Katrina and Young Masbath look at the rotors, and down at the     long distance between them and the ground.                             ICHABOD                Be ready...
[ACTION][WEAPON][CHARACTER][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][METAPHOR][SURPRISE][DANGER]     Ichabod throws the lantern into the windmill and runs.                             ICHABOD               Now!     INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT     The Horseman continues up.  The lantern falls past.

[ACTION][TRANSITION][METAPHOR][WEAPON][CHARACTER][CONFLICT][EXPOSITION][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][CHARACTERIZATION][MONSTER]     Grain dust is consumed instantaneously -- FLAMES ROAR     upwards, filling the windmill...     Engulfing the Horseman.
[METAPHOR][ACTION][TRANSITION][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][CONTEXT]     EXT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT     The rotor is halfway to its lowest point.  Masbath, Katrina     and Ichabod hang on as the entire structure trembles.     BOOM -- flames shoot out the windows, doors and seams,     lighting up the night.
[CONFLICT][PROBLEM][TRANSITION][DANGER]     On the rattling rotor, Ichabod struggles to hold the frame     with one hand and keep a grip on Katrina.     Masbath drops.  Ichabod releases Katrina, then drops.     They hit the ground.  Ichabod rolls, gasping, holding his
[SURPRISE][EMOTION][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][EXPOSITION][PROBLEM][PERSPECTIVE]     shoulder.  They all look at each other in disbelief a moment.     Ichabod lets out a sort of rasping laugh, standing.                             ICHABOD                Okay... come on...
[ACTION][TRANSITION][METAPHOR][WEAPON][EXPOSITION][CHARACTER][SURPRISE][DANGER][PERSPECTIVE][MONSTER]     Ichabod ushers them across the field, uphill.  Running.     Lightning flashes across the sky.  THUNDER RUMBLES.
[SURPRISE][ACTION][CONFLICT][EXPOSITION][CLIMAX][DANGER][WEAPON][TRANSITION][PROBLEM][DEATH][HORROR]     A bolt strikes the windmill, and it EXPLODES...     SHOCKWAVE DEAFENING.  The rotors bust apart.  Splinters of
[ACTION][METAPHOR][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][DANGER]     burning wood spin all directions.     ACROSS THE FIELD, Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath keep     running.  There is a WOODEN CART parked ahead.     IN THE WINDMILL RUBBLE, the Horseman rises, shoving off     burning debris.  His flame-ravaged uniform smolders.
[DANGER][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][METAPHOR][CONFLICT][ACTION][HORROR]     ACROSS THE FIELD, Ichabod stumbles onwards, but notices     something horrible...     In the distance, Lady Van Tassel's white horse roams free.

Young Masbath and Katrina are just past the cart when Lady     Van Tassel rises from behind it, swings a plank...
[CONFLICT]     SLAMS Ichabod in the chest and sends him down.     Lady Van Tassel grabs Katrina's hair, drags her.                             LADY VAN TASSEL               Should have stayed away, Constable.     Ichabod gets up slow, furious, reaches to his holster, only     to find it empty.  He moves forward.
[CONFLICT][DANGER][WEAPON][ACTION][MURDER]                             LADY VAN TASSEL               Keep back, or I kill her.     She takes out scissors, holds them to Katrina's neck.     Katrina ceases struggling.     Ichabod keeps Masbath behind him, keeps his distance.  Lady

[CONFLICT][PROBLEM][ACTION][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][DANGER][METAPHOR][WEAPON]     Lady Van Tassel spins and throws Katrina in the cart, shoving     against it.                             ICHABOD               No!     The cart rolls downhill.  Ichabod moves forward.
[CONFLICT][ACTION][TRANSITION][WEAPON][PROBLEM][METAPHOR][DANGER][MURDER]     Lady Van Tassel turns, brandishing the scissors, slashing and     missing.  Ichabod backs off.     DOWNHILL, the cart picks up speed, headed for the Horseman.     The Horseman starts running to meet it.
[EMOTION][CONFLICT][ACTION][TRANSITION][EXPOSITION][WEAPON]     UPHILL, Lady Van Tassel grins.                             LADY VAN TASSEL                Say goodbye to her.     Lady Van Tassel lunges, stabbing.  Ichabod avoids, puts all     his fury behind his fist -- punches her in the face.
[ACTION][PROBLEM][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][WEAPON][DANGER][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][MONSTER]     Lady Van Tassel hits the ground and her bag falls open,     sending the Horseman's skull rolling out...     The skull rolls... rolls... landing far away.
[ACTION][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][DANGER][PROBLEM]     DOWNHILL, Katrina leaps out from the cart...     She lands hard...
[SURPRISE][ACTION][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][DANGER][PROBLEM][METAPHOR]     The Horseman shoves the empty cart aside, still on the move.     UPHILL, Ichabod sees the skull.  He runs towards it.     Lady van Tassel grabs Ichabod by the ankle.  He falls.
[CONFLICT][ACTION][DANGER][TRANSITION][PROBLEM][METAPHOR]     DOWNHILL, Katrina runs back.  The Horseman is catching up.     UPHILL, Ichabod tries to pull f ree from Lady Van Tassel.     Young Masbath comes behind her - BAM - hits her in the head     with the wooden plank.  She's out.
[CONFLICT][ACTION][TRANSITION][METAPHOR][SURPRISE][DANGER][PROBLEM]     Ichabod scrambles to his feet.     DOWNHILL, the Horseman catches Katrina, taking her by the     hair as she falls to her knees and screams.     UPHILL, Ichabod runs... grasps the Horseman's skull.
[CONFLICT][TRANSITION][ACTION][WEAPON][SURPRISE][DANGER][PROBLEM][METAPHOR]     He runs towards the Horseman and Katrina.     DOWNHILL, Katrina struggles, but the Horseman holds her ready     by her hair... raises his sword...

[TRANSITION][ACTION][SURPRISE][CLIMAX][EXPOSITION][CONFLICT][EMOTION][MONSTER]     The Horseman holds the skull out, then brings it to his     shoulders, to its rightful place.  THUNDER POUNDS.

[CHARACTER][TRANSITION][METAPHOR][FLASHBACK][PERSPECTIVE][HORROR]     The Horseman's reformation continues.  Muscle forms.  Liquids     become solids.  He is made whole once more, the same evil,     human face we saw in Baltus' stories.     He looks to Ichabod and Katrina, touches his restored face.
[TRANSITION][EMOTION][ACTION][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][CHARACTER][CONFLICT][DANGER][COMEDIC HORROR]     Daredevil rides up, SCREECHING.  The Horseman replaces his     sward and climbs into the saddle.     He rides towards Katrina and Ichabod, but passes them by.     They are so exhausted they fall down.
[CONFLICT][TRANSITION]     Young Masbath backs up as the Horseman comes, but the     Horseman does not want him either.     The Horseman leans to grab Lady Van Tassel's unconscious     form, pulls her up across Daredevil's back.     He rides away with her.     Ichabod and Katrina watch him go.  They look at each other,

[TRANSITION][SURPRISE][DANGER][FLASHBACK][METAPHOR][HORROR]     Daredevil leaps just as a lightning bolt blasts down,     striking the Horseman.
