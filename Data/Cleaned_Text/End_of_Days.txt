While it contains some of the predictablebeats of a doomsday tale with a fairly static Satan figurethreatening to destroy the world, the battles that erupt betweenthe heroic security officer and the demonic forces are nicelyconceived and full of resourceful and inventive special effects.
[CHARACTER][DANGER][CONFLICT][PROBLEM]The piece is, after all, special effects driven with NYC takingthe brunt of all the destruction and mayhem. Not only is therechaos in the streets of the city as Satan and his minions try toestablish a foothold, but buildings collapse, others are pulledfrom the underground andfifireand brimstonei makes its presenceknownon a very large scale. The heart and soul, so to speak,of the drama lies in the characters of the heroic security officerwho becomes the iProtectorl of the woman chosen by Satan to be hiswife.

And speaking of glory—the material also is not afraid tobring up questions of faith and virtue; the heroic securityofficer is not afraid to finally ask for help from God, and it isin these final moments when he accepts God and renounces Satanthat the script has its most powerful emotional impact. The scriptwinds up succeeding on a couple of levelsthe truly physical,action driven one, and the more sensitive, holy one. The script

We wonder why the heroic officer,Jericho, was targeted for destruction from the beginningbeforehe even meets Satanis intended wife; and if this is the case, wewonder why Satan canit simply remove Jericho as an obstacle. As aresult of many similar questions the script seems, from time totime, to be overly manipulated and contrived. But the actionsequences seem to distract us from this, and the energy neversubsides. We also wonder why Satan canit just pick any woman he
