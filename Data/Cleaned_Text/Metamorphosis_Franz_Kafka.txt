Metamorphosis  Franz KafkaTranslated by David WyllieIOne morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he foundhimself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.  He lay onhis armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he couldsee his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiffsections.  The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready
[FRANZ KAFKA]to slide off any moment.  His many legs, pitifully thin comparedwith the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as helooked.[DIALOGUE]"What's happened to me?" he thought.  It wasn't a dream.  His room,a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefullybetween its four familiar walls.  A collection of textile samples
[FRANZ KAFKA][EMOTION]lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - andabove it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of anillustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame.  It showeda lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright,raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower armtowards the viewer.Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather.Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feelquite sad.  "How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all
[FRANZ KAFKA]this nonsense[DIALOGUE]", he thought, but that was something he was unable todo because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his presentstate couldn't get into that position.  However hard he threwhimself onto his right, he always rolled back to where he was.  Hemust have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that hewouldn't have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped whenhe began to feel a mild, dull pain there that he had never feltbefore."Oh, God[DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE]", he thought, "what a strenuous career it is that I'vechosen! Travelling day in and day out.  Doing business like thistakes much more effort than doing your own business at home, and ontop of that there's the curse of travelling, worries about makingtrain connections, bad and irregular food, contact with differentpeople all the time so that you can never get to know anyone orbecome friendly with them.  It can all go to Hell![DIALOGUE]"  He felt aslight itch up on his belly; pushed himself slowly up on his backtowards the headboard so that he could lift his head better; foundwhere the itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots of littlewhite spots which he didn't know what to make of; and when he triedto feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly backbecause as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder.He slid back into his former position.  "Getting up early all thetime", he thought, "it makes you stupid.  You've got to get enoughsleep.  Other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury.  For
[FRANZ KAFKA][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][DANGER][EMOTION][PERSPECTIVE][SURPRISE][ACTION][TRANSITION][MONSTER]instance, whenever I go back to the guest house during the morningto copy out the contract, these gentlemen are always still sittingthere eating their breakfasts.  I ought to just try that with myboss; I'd get kicked out on the spot.  But who knows, maybe thatwould be the best thing for me.  If I didn't have my parents tothink about I'd have given in my notice a long time ago, I'd havegone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell himeverything I would, let him know just what I feel.  He'd fall right
[FRANZ KAFKA][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][TRANSITION][DANGER][METAPHOR]off his desk! And it's a funny sort of business to be sitting upthere at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there,especially when you have to go right up close because the boss ishard of hearing.  Well, there's still some hope; once I've got themoney together to pay off my parents' debt to him - another five orsix years I suppose - that's definitely what I'll do.  That's whenI'll make the big change.  First of all though, I've got to get up,
[FRANZ KAFKA][EMOTION][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][PROBLEM][HORROR]my train leaves at five.[DIALOGUE]"And he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest ofdrawers.  "God in Heaven!" he thought.  It was half past six and thehands were quietly moving forwards, it was even later than halfpast, more like quarter to seven.  Had the alarm clock not rung? He
[FRANZ KAFKA][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][SETTING][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][DANGER]could see from the bed that it had been set for four o'clock as itshould have been; it certainly must have rung.  Yes, but was itpossible to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise?True, he had not slept peacefully, but probably all the more deeplybecause of that.  What should he do now? The next train went at
[FRANZ KAFKA][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][DANGER]seven; if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad andthe collection of samples was still not packed, and he did not atall feel particularly fresh and lively.  And even if he did catchthe train he would not avoid his boss's anger as the officeassistant would have been there to see the five o'clock train go, hewould have put in his report about Gregor's not being there a longtime ago.  The office assistant was the boss's man, spineless, andwith no understanding.  What about if he reported sick? But that
[FRANZ KAFKA][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][DANGER][GORE]would be extremely strained and suspicious as in fifteen years ofservice Gregor had never once yet been ill.  His boss wouldcertainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurancecompany, accuse his parents of having a lazy son, and accept thedoctor's recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believedthat no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy.  And what'smore, would he have been entirely wrong in this case? Gregor did infact, apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long,feel completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual.
[FRANZ KAFKA][SURPRISE][EMOTION][FLASHBACK][TRANSITION]He was still hurriedly thinking all this through, unable to decideto get out of the bed, when the clock struck quarter to seven.There was a cautious knock at the door near his head.  [DIALOGUE]"Gregor",somebody called - it was his mother - [DIALOGUE]"it's quarter to seven.Didn't you want to go somewhere?"  That gentle voice! Gregor wasshocked when he heard his own voice answering, it could hardly berecognised as the voice he had had before.  As if from deep inside
[FRANZ KAFKA][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][GORE]him, there was a painful and uncontrollable squeaking mixed in withit, the words could be made out at first but then there was a sortof echo which made them unclear, leaving the hearer unsure whetherhe had heard properly or not.  Gregor had wanted to give a fullanswer and explain everything, but in the circumstances contentedhimself with saying: [DIALOGUE]"Yes, mother, yes, thank-you, I'm getting upnow."  The change in Gregor's voice probably could not be noticedoutside through the wooden door, as his mother was satisfied withthis explanation and shuffled away.  But this short conversationmade the other members of the family aware that Gregor, againsttheir expectations was still at home, and soon his father cameknocking at one of the side doors, gently, but with his fist.[DIALOGUE]"Gregor, Gregor", he called, [DIALOGUE]"what's wrong?"  And after a shortwhile he called again with a warning deepness in his voice: "Gregor!
[FRANZ KAFKA]Gregor![DIALOGUE]"  At the other side door his sister came plaintively:"Gregor? Aren't you well? Do you need anything?[DIALOGUE]"  Gregor answered toboth sides: "I'm ready, now[DIALOGUE]", making an effort to remove all thestrangeness from his voice by enunciating very carefully and puttinglong pauses between each, individual word.  His father went back tohis breakfast, but his sister whispered: "Gregor, open the door, Ibeg of you."  Gregor, however, had no thought of opening the door,and instead congratulated himself for his cautious habit, acquiredfrom his travelling, of locking all doors at night even when he wasat home.The first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without beingdisturbed, to get dressed, and most of all to have his breakfast.
[FRANZ KAFKA][DANGER][TRANSITION]Only then would he consider what to do next, as he was well awarethat he would not bring his thoughts to any sensible conclusions bylying in bed.  He remembered that he had often felt a slight pain inbed, perhaps caused by lying awkwardly, but that had always turnedout to be pure imagination and he wondered how his imaginings wouldslowly resolve themselves today.  He did not have the slightestdoubt that the change in his voice was nothing more than the firstsign of a serious cold, which was an occupational hazard fortravelling salesmen.It was a simple matter to throw off the covers; he only had to blowhimself up a little and they fell off by themselves.  But it became
[FRANZ KAFKA][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][DANGER]difficult after that, especially as he was so exceptionally broad.He would have used his arms and his hands to push himself up; butinstead of them he only had all those little legs continuouslymoving in different directions, and which he was moreover unable tocontrol.  If he wanted to bend one of them, then that was the firstone that would stretch itself out; and if he finally managed to dowhat he wanted with that leg, all the others seemed to be set freeand would move about painfully.  [DIALOGUE]"This is something that can't bedone in bed", Gregor said to himself, [DIALOGUE]"so don't keep trying to doit".
[FRANZ KAFKA]The first thing he wanted to do was get the lower part of his bodyout of the bed, but he had never seen this lower part, and could notimagine what it looked like; it turned out to be too hard to move;it went so slowly; and finally, almost in a frenzy, when hecarelessly shoved himself forwards with all the force he couldgather, he chose the wrong direction, hit hard against the lowerbedpost, and learned from the burning pain he felt that the lowerpart of his body might well, at present, be the most sensitive.So then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bedfirst, carefully turning his head to the side.  This he managedquite easily, and despite its breadth and its weight, the bulk ofhis body eventually followed slowly in the direction of the head.But when he had at last got his head out of the bed and into thefresh air it occurred to him that if he let himself fall it would bea miracle if his head were not injured, so he became afraid to carryon pushing himself forward the same way.  And he could not knock
[FRANZ KAFKA]himself out now at any price; better to stay in bed than loseconsciousness.It took just as much effort to get back to where he had beenearlier, but when he lay there sighing, and was once more watchinghis legs as they struggled against each other even harder thanbefore, if that was possible, he could think of no way of bringingpeace and order to this chaos.  He told himself once more that itwas not possible for him to stay in bed and that the most sensiblething to do would be to get free of it in whatever way he could atwhatever sacrifice.  At the same time, though, he did not forget toremind himself that calm consideration was much better than rushingto desperate conclusions.  At times like this he would direct his
[FRANZ KAFKA][TRANSITION]eyes to the window and look out as clearly as he could, butunfortunately, even the other side of the narrow street wasenveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheerto offer him.  [DIALOGUE]"Seven o'clock, already", he said to himself when theclock struck again, [DIALOGUE]"seven o'clock, and there's still a fog likethis."  And he lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightlyas if he perhaps expected the total stillness to bring things backto their real and natural state.But then he said to himself: [DIALOGUE]"Before it strikes quarter past sevenI'll definitely have to have got properly out of bed.  And by thensomebody will have come round from work to ask what's happened to meas well, as they open up at work before seven o'clock."  And so heset himself to the task of swinging the entire length of his bodyout of the bed all at the same time.  If he succeeded in falling outof bed in this way and kept his head raised as he did so he couldprobably avoid injuring it.  His back seemed to be quite hard, and
[FRANZ KAFKA][PERSPECTIVE][TRANSITION][DANGER][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][METAPHOR]probably nothing would happen to it falling onto the carpet.  Hismain concern was for the loud noise he was bound to make, and whicheven through all the doors would probably raise concern if notalarm.  But it was something that had to be risked.When Gregor was already sticking half way out of the bed - the newmethod was more of a game than an effort, all he had to do was rockback and forth - it occurred to him how simple everything would beif somebody came to help him.  Two strong people - he had his father
[FRANZ KAFKA][EMOTION][TRANSITION][DANGER]and the maid in mind - would have been more than enough; they wouldonly have to push their arms under the dome of his back, peel himaway from the bed, bend down with the load and then be patient andcareful as he swang over onto the floor, where, hopefully, thelittle legs would find a use.  Should he really call for helpthough, even apart from the fact that all the doors were locked?Despite all the difficulty he was in, he could not suppress a smileat this thought.After a while he had already moved so far across that it would havebeen hard for him to keep his balance if he rocked too hard.  The
[FRANZ KAFKA][TRANSITION]time was now ten past seven and he would have to make a finaldecision very soon.  Then there was a ring at the door of the flat.[DIALOGUE]"That'll be someone from work", he said to himself, and froze verystill, although his little legs only became all the more lively asthey danced around.  For a moment everything remained quiet.
[FRANZ KAFKA][DIALOGUE]"They're not opening the door", Gregor said to himself, caught insome nonsensical hope.  But then of course, the maid's firm stepswent to the door as ever and opened it.  Gregor only needed to hearthe visitor's first words of greeting and he knew who it was - thechief clerk himself.  Why did Gregor have to be the only onecondemned to work for a company where they immediately became highlysuspicious at the slightest shortcoming? Were all employees, every
[FRANZ KAFKA][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][EMOTION][PROBLEM][TRANSITION][ACTION][DANGER]one of them, louts, was there not one of them who was faithful anddevoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience that hecouldn't get out of bed if he didn't spend at least a couple ofhours in the morning on company business? Was it really not enoughto let one of the trainees make enquiries - assuming enquiries wereeven necessary - did the chief clerk have to come himself, and didthey have to show the whole, innocent family that this was sosuspicious that only the chief clerk could be trusted to have thewisdom to investigate it? And more because these thoughts had madehim upset than through any proper decision, he swang himself withall his force out of the bed.  There was a loud thump, but it wasn'treally a loud noise.  His fall was softened a little by the carpet,
[FRANZ KAFKA][SURPRISE]and Gregor's back was also more elastic than he had thought, whichmade the sound muffled and not too noticeable.  He had not held hishead carefully enough, though, and hit it as he fell; annoyed and inpain, he turned it and rubbed it against the carpet.[DIALOGUE]"Something's fallen down in there", said the chief clerk in the roomon the left.  Gregor tried to imagine whether something of the sortthat had happened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerktoo; you had to concede that it was possible.  But as if in gruff
[FRANZ KAFKA][GORE]reply to this question, the chief clerk's firm footsteps in hishighly polished boots could now be heard in the adjoining room.From the room on his right, Gregor's sister whispered to him to lethim know: [DIALOGUE]"Gregor, the chief clerk is here."  [DIALOGUE]"Yes, I know", saidGregor to himself; but without daring to raise his voice loud enoughfor his sister to hear him.[DIALOGUE]"Gregor", said his father now from the room to his left, "the chiefclerk has come round and wants to know why you didn't leave on theearly train.  We don't know what to say to him.  And anyway, hewants to speak to you personally.  So please open up this door.  I'm
[FRANZ KAFKA][EMOTION][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][METAPHOR]sure he'll be good enough to forgive the untidiness of your room.[DIALOGUE]"Then the chief clerk called "Good morning,  Mr. Samsa[DIALOGUE]". "He isn'twell[DIALOGUE]", said his mother to the chief clerk, while his fathercontinued to speak through the door.  "He isn't well, please believeme.  Why else would Gregor have missed a train! The lad only ever
[FRANZ KAFKA][PERSPECTIVE]thinks about the business.  It nearly makes me cross the way henever goes out in the evenings; he's been in town for a week now butstayed home every evening.  He sits with us in the kitchen and justreads the paper or studies train timetables.  His idea of relaxationis working with his fretsaw.  He's made a little frame, for
[FRANZ KAFKA]instance, it only took him two or three evenings, you'll be amazedhow nice it is; it's hanging up in his room; you'll see it as soonas Gregor opens the door.  Anyway, I'm glad you're here; we wouldn'thave been able to get Gregor to open the door by ourselves; he's sostubborn; and I'm sure he isn't well, he said this morning that heis, but he isn't.[DIALOGUE]"  "I'll be there in a moment[DIALOGUE]", said Gregor slowlyand thoughtfully, but without moving so that he would not miss anyword of the conversation.  "Well I can't think of any other way ofexplaining it,  Mrs. Samsa[DIALOGUE]", said the chief clerk, "I hope it'snothing serious.  But on the other hand, I must say that if we
[FRANZ KAFKA][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][CONTEXT][EMOTION]people in commerce ever become slightly unwell then, fortunately orunfortunately as you like, we simply have to overcome it because ofbusiness considerations.[DIALOGUE]"  "Can the chief clerk come in to see younow then?[DIALOGUE]", asked his father impatiently, knocking at the dooragain.  "No", said Gregor.  In the room on his right there followeda painful silence; in the room on his left his sister began to cry.
[FRANZ KAFKA]So why did his sister not go and join the others? She had probablyonly just got up and had not even begun to get dressed.  And why wasshe crying? Was it because he had not got up, and had not let thechief clerk in, because he was in danger of losing his job and ifthat happened his boss would once more pursue their parents with thesame demands as before? There was no need to worry about things like
[FRANZ KAFKA][PERSPECTIVE][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][TRANSITION][CONTEXT][CHARACTERIZATION][FLASHBACK]that yet.  Gregor was still there and had not the slightestintention of abandoning his family.  For the time being he just laythere on the carpet, and no-one who knew the condition he was inwould seriously have expected him to let the chief clerk in.  It wasonly a minor discourtesy, and a suitable excuse could easily befound for it later on, it was not something for which Gregor couldbe sacked on the spot.  And it seemed to Gregor much more sensible
[FRANZ KAFKA][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][DANGER]to leave him now in peace instead of disturbing him with talking athim and crying.  But the others didn't know what was happening, theywere worried, that would excuse their behaviour.The chief clerk now raised his voice, [DIALOGUE]"Mr. Samsa", he called to him,"what is wrong? You barricade yourself in your room, give us no morethan yes or no for an answer, you are causing serious andunnecessary concern to your parents and you fail - and I mentionthis just by the way - you fail to carry out your business duties ina way that is quite unheard of.  I'm speaking here on behalf of your
[FRANZ KAFKA][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][DANGER]parents and of your employer, and really must request a clear andimmediate explanation.  I am astonished, quite astonished.  Ithought I knew you as a calm and sensible person, and now yousuddenly seem to be showing off with peculiar whims.  This morning,your employer did suggest a possible reason for your failure toappear, it's true - it had to do with the money that was recentlyentrusted to you - but I came near to giving him my word of honourthat that could not be the right explanation.  But now that I seeyour incomprehensible stubbornness I no longer feel any wishwhatsoever to intercede on your behalf.  And nor is your position
[FRANZ KAFKA]all that secure.  I had originally intended to say all this to youin private, but since you cause me to waste my time here for no goodreason I don't see why your parents should not also learn of it.Your turnover has been very unsatisfactory of late; I grant you thatit's not the time of year to do especially good business, werecognise that; but there simply is no time of year to do nobusiness at all,  Mr. Samsa, we cannot allow there to be.[DIALOGUE]""But Sir[DIALOGUE]", called Gregor, beside himself and forgetting all else inthe excitement, "I'll open up immediately, just a moment.  I'm
[FRANZ KAFKA][SURPRISE][TRANSITION]slightly unwell, an attack of dizziness, I haven't been able to getup.  I'm still in bed now.  I'm quite fresh again now, though.  I'mjust getting out of bed.  Just a moment.  Be patient! It's not quite
[FRANZ KAFKA][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE]as easy as I'd thought.  I'm quite alright now, though.  It'sshocking, what can suddenly happen to a person! I was quite alrightlast night, my parents know about it, perhaps better than me, I hada small symptom of it last night already.  They must have noticed
[FRANZ KAFKA][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][DANGER][CONFLICT][METAPHOR]it.  I don't know why I didn't let you know at work! But you alwaysthink you can get over an illness without staying at home.  Please,don't make my parents suffer! There's no basis for any of the
[FRANZ KAFKA][SURPRISE][CONFLICT]accusations you're making; nobody's ever said a word to me about anyof these things.  Maybe you haven't read the latest contracts I sentin.  I'll set off with the eight o'clock train, as well, these fewhours of rest have given me strength.  You don't need to wait, sir;I'll be in the office soon after you, and please be so good as totell that to the boss and recommend me to him!"
[FRANZ KAFKA]And while Gregor gushed out these words, hardly knowing what he wassaying, he made his way over to the chest of drawers - this waseasily done, probably because of the practise he had already had inbed - where he now tried to get himself upright.  He really did wantto open the door, really did want to let them see him and to speakwith the chief clerk; the others were being so insistent, and he wascurious to learn what they would say when they caught sight of him.If they were shocked then it would no longer be Gregor'sresponsibility and he could rest.  If, however, they took everythingcalmly he would still have no reason to be upset, and if he hurriedhe really could be at the station for eight o'clock.  The first few
[FRANZ KAFKA]times he tried to climb up on the smooth chest of drawers he justslid down again, but he finally gave himself one last swing andstood there upright; the lower part of his body was in serious painbut he no longer gave any attention to it.  Now he let himself fallagainst the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the edges ofit with his little legs.  By now he had also calmed down, and keptquiet so that he could listen to what the chief clerk was saying.[DIALOGUE]"Did you understand a word of all that?" the chief clerk asked hisparents, [DIALOGUE]"surely he's not trying to make fools of us". [DIALOGUE]"Oh, God!"called his mother, who was already in tears, [DIALOGUE]"he could be seriouslyill and we're making him suffer.  Grete! Grete!" she then cried.
[FRANZ KAFKA][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][DANGER][EMOTION][ACTION][DIALOGUE]"Mother?" his sister called from the other side.  They communicatedacross Gregor's room.  "You'll have to go for the doctor straightaway.  Gregor is ill.  Quick, get the doctor.  Did you hear the way
[FRANZ KAFKA][HORROR]Gregor spoke just now?[DIALOGUE]"  "That was the voice of an animal[DIALOGUE]", said thechief clerk, with a calmness that was in contrast with his mother'sscreams.  "Anna! Anna![DIALOGUE]" his father called into the kitchen throughthe entrance hall, clapping his hands, "get a locksmith here, now!"And the two girls, their skirts swishing, immediately ran outthrough the hall, wrenching open the front door of the flat as theywent.  How had his sister managed to get dressed so quickly? Therewas no sound of the door banging shut again; they must have left itopen;  people often do in homes where something awful has happened.
[FRANZ KAFKA]Gregor, in contrast, had become much calmer.  So they couldn'tunderstand his words any more, although they seemed clear enough tohim, clearer than before - perhaps his ears had become used to thesound.  They had realised, though, that there was something wrongwith him, and were ready to help.  The first response to hissituation had been confident and wise, and that made him feelbetter.  He felt that he had been drawn back in among people, and
[FRANZ KAFKA][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][TRANSITION]from the doctor and the locksmith he expected great and surprisingachievements - although he did not really distinguish one from theother.  Whatever was said next would be crucial, so, in order tomake his voice as clear as possible, he coughed a little, but takingcare to do this not too loudly as even this might well sounddifferent from the way that a human coughs and he was no longer surehe could judge this for himself.  Meanwhile, it had become veryquiet in the next room.  Perhaps his parents were sat at the tablewhispering with the chief clerk, or perhaps they were all pressedagainst the door and listening.
[FRANZ KAFKA][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][ACTION][WEAPON][DANGER][METAPHOR][PERSPECTIVE][GORE]Gregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair.  Oncethere he let go of it and threw himself onto the door, holdinghimself upright against it using the adhesive on the tips of hislegs.  He rested there a little while to recover from the effortinvolved and then set himself to the task of turning the key in thelock with his mouth.  He seemed, unfortunately, to have no properteeth - how was he, then, to grasp the key? - but the lack of teeth
[FRANZ KAFKA][EMOTION]was, of course, made up for with a very strong jaw; using the jaw,he really was able to start the key turning, ignoring the fact thathe must have been causing some kind of damage as a brown fluid camefrom his mouth, flowed over the key and dripped onto the floor.[DIALOGUE]"Listen", said the chief clerk in the next room, [DIALOGUE]"he's turning thekey."  Gregor was greatly encouraged by this; but they all shouldhave been calling to him, his father and his mother too: [DIALOGUE]"Well done,Gregor", they should have cried, [DIALOGUE]"keep at it, keep hold of thelock!"  And with the idea that they were all excitedly following hisefforts, he bit on the key with all his strength, paying noattention to the pain he was causing himself.  As the key turnedround he turned around the lock with it, only holding himselfupright with his mouth, and hung onto the key or pushed it downagain with the whole weight of his body as needed.  The clear soundof the lock as it snapped back was Gregor's sign that he could breakhis concentration, and as he regained his breath he said to himself:[DIALOGUE]"So, I didn't need the locksmith after all". Then he lay his head on
[FRANZ KAFKA][DANGER][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][ACTION][CONFLICT]the handle of the door to open it completely.Because he had to open the door in this way, it was already wideopen before he could be seen.  He had first to slowly turn himselfaround one of the double doors, and he had to do it very carefullyif he did not want to fall flat on his back before entering theroom.  He was still occupied with this difficult movement, unable topay attention to anything else, when he heard the chief clerkexclaim a loud [DIALOGUE]"Oh!", which sounded like the soughing of the wind.
[FRANZ KAFKA][TRANSITION]Now he also saw him - he was the nearest to the door - his handpressed against his open mouth and slowly retreating as if driven bya steady and invisible force.  Gregor's mother, her hair stilldishevelled from bed despite the chief clerk's being there, lookedat his father.  Then she unfolded her arms, took two steps forwardtowards Gregor and sank down onto the floor into her skirts thatspread themselves out around her as her head disappeared down ontoher breast.  His father looked hostile, and clenched his fists as ifwanting to knock Gregor back into his room.  Then he looked
[FRANZ KAFKA][CONFLICT]uncertainly round the living room, covered his eyes with his handsand wept so that his powerful chest shook.So Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the inside ofthe other door which was still held bolted in place.  In this wayonly half of his body could be seen, along with his head above itwhich he leant over to one side as he peered out at the others.Meanwhile the day had become much lighter; part of the endless,grey-black building on the other side of the street - which was ahospital - could be seen quite clearly with the austere and regularline of windows piercing its facade; the rain was stillfalling, now throwing down large, individual droplets which hit theground one at a time.  The washing up from breakfast lay on the
[FRANZ KAFKA][TRANSITION]table; there was so much of it because, for Gregor's father,breakfast was the most important meal of the day and he wouldstretch it out for several hours as he sat reading a number ofdifferent newspapers.  On the wall exactly opposite there wasphotograph of Gregor when he was a lieutenant in the army, his swordin his hand and a carefree smile on his face as he called forthrespect for his uniform and bearing.  The door to the entrance hallwas open and as the front door of the flat was also open he couldsee onto the landing and the stairs where they began their way downbelow.[DIALOGUE]"Now, then", said Gregor, well aware that he was the only one tohave kept calm, "I'll get dressed straight away now, pack up mysamples and set off.  Will you please just let me leave? You can
[FRANZ KAFKA][TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][CHARACTER][CHARACTERIZATION][EXPOSITION][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][PROBLEM][CONTEXT][CONFLICT][COMEDIC HORROR]see[DIALOGUE]", he said to the chief clerk, "that I'm not stubborn and Ilike to do my job; being a commercial traveller is arduous butwithout travelling I couldn't earn my living.  So where are yougoing, in to the office? Yes? Will you report everything accurately,then? It's quite possible for someone to be temporarily unable to
[FRANZ KAFKA][CONFLICT][PERSPECTIVE][FLASHBACK][TRANSITION][CONTEXT]work, but that's just the right time to remember what's beenachieved in the past and consider that later on, once the difficultyhas been removed, he will certainly work with all the more diligenceand concentration.  You're well aware that I'm seriously in debt toour employer as well as having to look after my parents and mysister, so that I'm trapped in a difficult situation, but I willwork my way out of it again.  Please don't make things any harderfor me than they are already, and don't take sides against me at theoffice.  I know that nobody likes the travellers.  They think we
[FRANZ KAFKA][METAPHOR][CHARACTERIZATION][SURPRISE][DANGER][PROBLEM][FLASHBACK]earn an enormous wage as well as having a soft time of it.  That'sjust prejudice but they have no particular reason to think better ofit.  But you, sir, you have a better overview than the rest of thestaff, in fact, if I can say this in confidence, a better overviewthan the boss himself - it's very easy for a businessman like him tomake mistakes about his employees and judge them more harshly thanhe should.  And you're also well aware that we travellers spendalmost the whole year away from the office, so that we can veryeasily fall victim to gossip and chance and groundless complaints,and it's almost impossible to defend yourself from that sort ofthing, we don't usually even hear about them, or if at all it's whenwe arrive back home exhausted from a trip, and that's when we feelthe harmful effects of what's been going on without even knowingwhat caused them.  Please, don't go away, at least first say
[FRANZ KAFKA][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][PERSPECTIVE][CHARACTERIZATION][PROBLEM][CONTEXT]something to show that you grant that I'm at least partly right!"But the chief clerk had turned away as soon as Gregor had started tospeak, and, with protruding lips, only stared back at him over histrembling shoulders as he left.  He did not keep still for a momentwhile Gregor was speaking, but moved steadily towards the doorwithout taking his eyes off him.  He moved very gradually, as ifthere had been some secret prohibition on leaving the room.  It was
[FRANZ KAFKA][DANGER][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][SURPRISE]only when he had reached the entrance hall that he made a suddenmovement, drew his foot from the living room, and rushed forward ina panic.  In the hall, he stretched his right hand far out towardsthe stairway as if out there, there were some supernatural forcewaiting to save him.Gregor realised that it was out of the question to let the chiefclerk go away in this mood if his position in the firm was not to beput into extreme danger.  That was something his parents did notunderstand very well; over the years, they had become convinced thatthis job would provide for Gregor for his entire life, and besides,they had so much to worry about at present that they had lost sightof any thought for the future.  Gregor, though, did think about the
[FRANZ KAFKA][CONFLICT][EMOTION][PERSPECTIVE][TRANSITION][PROBLEM]future.  The chief clerk had to be held back, calmed down, convincedand finally won over; the future of Gregor and his family dependedon it! If only his sister were here! She was clever; she was alreadyin tears while Gregor was still lying peacefully on his back.  And
[FRANZ KAFKA][RELIEF][SURPRISE][EMOTION][TRANSITION]the chief clerk was a lover of women, surely she could persuade him;she would close the front door in the entrance hall and talk him outof his shocked state.  But his sister was not there, Gregor wouldhave to do the job himself.  And without considering that he stillwas not familiar with how well he could move about in his presentstate, or that his speech still might not - or probably would not -be understood, he let go of the door; pushed himself through theopening; tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing who,ridiculously, was holding on to the banister with both hands; butGregor fell immediately over and, with a little scream as he soughtsomething to hold onto, landed on his numerous little legs.  Hardlyhad that happened than, for the first time that day, he began tofeel alright with his body; the little legs had the solid groundunder them; to his pleasure, they did exactly as he told them; theywere even making the effort to carry him where he wanted to go; andhe was soon believing that all his sorrows would soon be finally atan end.  He held back the urge to move but swayed from side to side
[FRANZ KAFKA][EMOTION][SURPRISE]as he crouched there on the floor.  His mother was not far away infront of him and seemed, at first, quite engrossed in herself, butthen she suddenly jumped up with her arms outstretched and herfingers spread shouting: [DIALOGUE]"Help, for pity's sake, Help!"  The way sheheld her head suggested she wanted to see Gregor better, but theunthinking way she was hurrying backwards showed that she did not;she had forgotten that the table was behind her with all thebreakfast things on it; when she reached the table she sat quicklydown on it without knowing what she was doing; without even seemingto notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush ofcoffee was pouring down onto the carpet.[DIALOGUE]"Mother, mother", said Gregor gently, looking up at her.  He hadcompletely forgotten the chief clerk for the moment, but could nothelp himself snapping in the air with his jaws at the sight of theflow of coffee.  That set his mother screaming anew, she fled from
[FRANZ KAFKA][CONFLICT][DANGER]the table and into the arms of his father as he rushed towards her.Gregor, though, had no time to spare for his parents now; the chiefclerk had already reached the stairs; with his chin on the banister,he looked back for the last time.  Gregor made a run for him; hewanted to be sure of reaching him; the chief clerk must haveexpected something, as he leapt down several steps at once anddisappeared; his shouts resounding all around the staircase.  Theflight of the chief clerk seemed, unfortunately, to put Gregor'sfather into a panic as well.  Until then he had been relatively self
[FRANZ KAFKA][CONFLICT]controlled, but now, instead of running after the chief clerkhimself, or at least not impeding Gregor as he ran after him,Gregor's father seized the chief clerk's stick in his right hand(the chief clerk had left it behind on a chair, along with his hatand overcoat), picked up a large newspaper from the table with hisleft, and used them to drive Gregor back into his room, stamping hisfoot at him as he went.  Gregor's appeals to his father were of nohelp, his appeals were simply not understood, however much he humblyturned his head his father merely stamped his foot all the harder.Across the room, despite the chilly weather, Gregor's mother hadpulled open a window, leant far out of it and pressed her hands toher face.  A strong draught of air flew in from the street towardsthe stairway, the curtains flew up, the newspapers on the tablefluttered and some of them were blown onto the floor.  Nothing would
[FRANZ KAFKA][DANGER][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][SURPRISE]stop Gregor's father as he drove him back, making hissing noises athim like a wild man.  Gregor had never had any practice in movingbackwards and was only able to go very slowly.  If Gregor had onlybeen allowed to turn round he would have been back in his roomstraight away, but he was afraid that if he took the time to do thathis father would become impatient, and there was the threat of alethal blow to his back or head from the stick in his father's handany moment.  Eventually, though, Gregor realised that he had nochoice as he saw, to his disgust, that he was quite incapable ofgoing backwards in a straight line; so he began, as quickly aspossible and with frequent anxious glances at his father, to turnhimself round.  It went very slowly, but perhaps his father was able
[FRANZ KAFKA][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][GORE]to see his good intentions as he did nothing to hinder him, in factnow and then he used the tip of his stick to give directions from adistance as to which way to turn.  If only his father would stopthat unbearable hissing! It was making Gregor quite confused.  Whenhe had nearly finished turning round, still listening to thathissing, he made a mistake and turned himself back a little the wayhe had just come.  He was pleased when he finally had his head in
[FRANZ KAFKA][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][EMOTION][ACTION][PERSPECTIVE]front of the doorway, but then saw that it was too narrow, and hisbody was too broad to get through it without further difficulty.  Inhis present mood, it obviously did not occur to his father to openthe other of the double doors so that Gregor would have enough spaceto get through.  He was merely fixed on the idea that Gregor shouldbe got back into his room as quickly as possible.  Nor would he everhave allowed Gregor the time to get himself upright as preparationfor getting through the doorway.  What he did, making more noise
[FRANZ KAFKA][CONFLICT]than ever, was to drive Gregor forwards all the harder as if therehad been nothing in the way; it sounded to Gregor as if there wasnow more than one father behind him; it was not a pleasantexperience, and Gregor pushed himself into the doorway withoutregard for what might happen.  One side of his body lifted itself,he lay at an angle in the doorway, one flank scraped on the whitedoor and was painfully injured, leaving vile brown flecks on it,soon he was stuck fast and would not have been able to move at allby himself, the little legs along one side hung quivering in the airwhile those on the other side were pressed painfully against theground.  Then his father gave him a hefty shove from behind whichreleased him from where he was held and sent him flying, and heavilybleeding, deep into his room.  The door was slammed shut with thestick, then, finally, all was quiet.
[FRANZ KAFKA]IIIt was not until it was getting dark that evening that Gregor awokefrom his deep and coma-like sleep.  He would have woken soonafterwards anyway even if he hadn't been disturbed, as he had hadenough sleep and felt fully rested.  But he had the impression thatsome hurried steps and the sound of the door leading into the frontroom being carefully shut had woken him.  The light from theelectric street lamps shone palely here and there onto the ceilingand tops of the furniture, but down below, where Gregor was, it wasdark.  He pushed himself over to the door, feeling his way clumsily
[FRANZ KAFKA][SURPRISE][METAPHOR]with his antennae - of which he was now beginning to learn the value- in order to see what had been happening there.  The whole of hisleft side seemed like one, painfully stretched scar,  and he limpedbadly on his two rows of legs.  One of the legs had been badlyinjured in the events of that morning - it was nearly a miracle thatonly one of them had been - and dragged along lifelessly.It was only when he had reached the door that he realised what itactually was that had drawn him over to it; it was the smell ofsomething to eat.  By the door there was a dish filled with
[FRANZ KAFKA]sweetened milk with little pieces of white bread floating in it.  Hewas so pleased he almost laughed, as he was even hungrier than hehad been that morning, and immediately dipped his head into themilk, nearly covering his eyes with it.  But he soon drew his headback again in disappointment; not only did the pain in his tenderleft side make it difficult to eat the food - he was only able toeat if his whole body worked together as a snuffling whole - but themilk did not taste at all nice.  Milk like this was normally hisfavourite drink, and his sister had certainly left it there for himbecause of that, but he turned, almost against his own will, awayfrom the dish and crawled back into the centre of the room.
[FRANZ KAFKA]Through the crack in the door, Gregor could see that the gas hadbeen lit in the living room.  His father at this time would normallybe sat with his evening paper, reading it out in a loud voice toGregor's mother, and sometimes to his sister, but there was now nota sound to be heard.  Gregor's sister would often write and tell himabout this reading, but maybe his father had lost the habit inrecent times.  It was so quiet all around too, even though theremust have been somebody in the flat.  "What a quiet life it is the
[FRANZ KAFKA]family lead", said Gregor to himself, and, gazing into the darkness,felt a great pride that he was able to provide a life like that insuch a nice home for his sister and parents.  But what now, if allthis peace and wealth and comfort should come to a horrible andfrightening end? That was something that Gregor did not want tothink about too much, so he started to move about, crawling up anddown the room.Once during that long evening, the door on one side of the room wasopened very slightly and hurriedly closed again; later on the dooron the other side did the same; it seemed that someone needed toenter the room but thought better of it.  Gregor went and waited
[FRANZ KAFKA][TRANSITION]immediately by the door, resolved either to bring the timorousvisitor into the room in some way or at least to find out who itwas; but the door was opened no more that night and Gregor waited invain.  The previous morning while the doors were locked everyone hadwanted to get in there to him, but now, now that he had opened upone of the doors and the other had clearly been unlocked some timeduring the day, no-one came, and the keys were in the other sides.It was not until late at night that the gaslight in the living roomwas put out, and now it was easy to see that his parents and sister hadstayed awake all that time, as they all could be distinctly heard asthey went away together on tip-toe.  It was clear that no-one wouldcome into Gregor's room any more until morning; that gave him plentyof time to think undisturbed about how he would have to re-arrangehis life.  For some reason, the tall, empty room where he was forced
[FRANZ KAFKA]to remain made him feel uneasy as he lay there flat on the floor,even though he had been living in it for five years.  Hardly awareof what he was doing other than a slight feeling of shame, hehurried under the couch.  It pressed down on his back a little, andhe was no longer able to lift his head, but he nonetheless feltimmediately at ease and his only regret was that his body was toobroad to get it all underneath.He spent the whole night there.  Some of the time he passed in a
[FRANZ KAFKA][EMOTION]light sleep, although he frequently woke from it in alarm because ofhis hunger, and some of the time was spent in worries and vaguehopes which, however, always led to the same conclusion: for thetime being he must remain calm, he must show patience and thegreatest consideration so that his family could bear theunpleasantness that he, in his present condition, was forced toimpose on them.Gregor soon had the opportunity to test the strength of hisdecisions, as early the next morning, almost before the night hadended, his sister, nearly fully dressed, opened the door from thefront room and looked anxiously in.  She did not see him straightaway, but when she did notice him under the couch - he had to besomewhere, for God's sake, he couldn't have flown away - she was soshocked that she lost control of herself and slammed the door shutagain from outside.  But she seemed to regret her behaviour, as sheopened the door again straight away and came in on tip-toe as ifentering the room of someone seriously ill or even of a stranger.
[FRANZ KAFKA][SURPRISE]Gregor had pushed his head forward, right to the edge of the couch,and watched her.  Would she notice that he had left the milk as itwas, realise that it was not from any lack of hunger and bring himin some other food that was more suitable? If she didn't do itherself he would rather go hungry than draw her attention to it,although he did feel a terrible urge to rush forward from under thecouch, throw himself at his sister's feet and beg her for somethinggood to eat.  However, his sister noticed the full dish immediatelyand looked at it and the few drops of milk splashed around it withsome surprise.  She immediately picked it up - using a rag,
[FRANZ KAFKA]not her bare hands - and carried it out.  Gregor was extremelycurious as to what she would bring in its place, imagining thewildest possibilities, but he never could have guessed what hissister, in her goodness, actually did bring.  In order to test histaste, she brought him a whole selection of things, all spread outon an old newspaper.  There were old, half-rotten vegetables; bonesfrom the evening meal, covered in white sauce that had gone hard; afew raisins and almonds; some cheese that Gregor had declaredinedible two days before; a dry roll and some bread spread withbutter and salt.  As well as all that she had poured some water into
[FRANZ KAFKA]the dish, which had probably been permanently set aside for Gregor'suse, and placed it beside them.  Then, out of consideration forGregor's feelings, as she knew that he would not eat in front ofher, she hurried out again and even turned the key in the lock sothat Gregor would know he could make things as comfortable forhimself as he liked.  Gregor's little legs whirred, at last he couldeat.  What's more, his injuries must already have completely healedas he found no difficulty in moving.  This amazed him, as more than
[FRANZ KAFKA]a month earlier he had cut his finger slightly with a knife, hethought of how his finger had still hurt the day before yesterday.[DIALOGUE]"Am I less sensitive than I used to be, then?", he thought, and wasalready sucking greedily at the cheese which had immediately, almostcompellingly, attracted him much more than the other foods on thenewspaper.  Quickly one after another, his eyes watering withpleasure, he consumed the cheese, the vegetables and the sauce; thefresh foods, on the other hand, he didn't like at all, and evendragged the things he did want to eat a little way away from thembecause he couldn't stand the smell.  Long after he had finishedeating and lay lethargic in the same place, his sister slowly turnedthe key in the lock as a sign to him that he should withdraw.  Hewas immediately startled, although he had been half asleep, and hehurried back under the couch.  But he needed great self-control to
[FRANZ KAFKA]stay there even for the short time that his sister was in the room,as eating so much food had rounded out his body a little and hecould hardly breathe in that narrow space.  Half suffocating, hewatched with bulging eyes as his sister unselfconsciously took abroom and swept up the left-overs, mixing them in with the food hehad not even touched at all as if it could not be used any more.She quickly dropped it all into a bin, closed it with its woodenlid, and carried everything out.  She had hardly turned her backbefore Gregor came out again from under the couch and stretchedhimself.
[FRANZ KAFKA][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][EMOTION][GORE]This was how Gregor received his food each day now, once in themorning while his parents and the maid were still asleep, and thesecond time after everyone had eaten their meal at midday as hisparents would sleep for a little while then as well, and Gregor'ssister would send the maid away on some errand.  Gregor's father andmother certainly did not want him to starve either, but perhaps itwould have been more than they could stand to have any moreexperience of his feeding than being told about it, and perhaps hissister wanted to spare them what distress she could as they wereindeed suffering enough.It was impossible for Gregor to find out what they had told thedoctor and the locksmith that first morning to get them out of theflat.  As nobody could understand him, nobody, not even his sister,thought that he could understand them, so he had to be content tohear his sister's sighs and appeals to the saints as she moved abouthis room.  It was only later, when she had become a little more used
[FRANZ KAFKA]to everything - there was, of course, no question of her everbecoming fully used to the situation - that Gregor would sometimescatch a friendly comment, or at least a comment that could beconstrued as friendly.  [DIALOGUE]"He's enjoyed his dinner today", she mightsay when he had diligently cleared away all the food left for him,or if he left most of it, which slowly became more and morefrequent, she would often say, sadly, [DIALOGUE]"now everything's just beenleft there again".Although Gregor wasn't able to hear any news directly he did listento much of what was said in the next rooms, and whenever he heardanyone speaking he would scurry straight to the appropriate door andpress his whole body against it.  There was seldom any conversation,especially at first, that was not about him in some way, even ifonly in secret.  For two whole days, all the talk at every mealtime
[FRANZ KAFKA][EMOTION][ACTION][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][GORE]was about what they should do now; but even between meals they spokeabout the same subject as there were always at least two members ofthe family at home - nobody wanted to be at home by themselves andit was out of the question to leave the flat entirely empty.  And onthe very first day the maid had fallen to her knees and beggedGregor's mother to let her go without delay.  It was not very clearhow much she knew of what had happened but she left within a quarterof an hour, tearfully thanking Gregor's mother for her dismissal asif she had done her an enormous service.  She even sworeemphatically not to tell anyone the slightest about what hadhappened, even though no-one had asked that of her.
[FRANZ KAFKA][CONTEXT][PERSPECTIVE]Now Gregor's sister also had to help his mother with the cooking;although that was not so much bother as no-one ate very much.Gregor often heard how one of them would unsuccessfully urge anotherto eat, and receive no more answer than [DIALOGUE]"no thanks, I've had enough"or something similar.  No-one drank very much either.  His sisterwould sometimes ask his father whether he would like a beer, hopingfor the chance to go and fetch it herself.  When his father then
[FRANZ KAFKA]said nothing she would add, so that he would not feel selfish, thatshe could send the housekeeper for it, but then his father wouldclose the matter with a big, loud [DIALOGUE]"No", and no more would be said.Even before the first day had come to an end, his father hadexplained to Gregor's mother and sister what their finances andprospects were.  Now and then he stood up from the table and tooksome receipt or document from the little cash box he had saved fromhis business when it had collapsed five years earlier.  Gregor heardhow he opened the complicated lock and then closed it again after hehad taken the item he wanted.  What he heard his father say was some
[FRANZ KAFKA][TRANSITION][ACTION][RELIEF][PERSPECTIVE][RESOLUTION][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK]of the first good news that Gregor heard since he had first beenincarcerated in his room.  He had thought that nothing at allremained from his father's business, at least he had never told himanything different, and Gregor had never asked him about it anyway.Their business misfortune had reduced the family to a state of totaldespair, and Gregor's only concern at that time had been to arrangethings so that they could all forget about it as quickly aspossible.  So then he started working especially hard, with a fieryvigour that raised him from a junior salesman to a travellingrepresentative almost overnight, bringing with it the chance to earnmoney in quite different ways.  Gregor converted his success at work
[FRANZ KAFKA]straight into cash that he could lay on the table at home for thebenefit of his astonished and delighted family.  They had been goodtimes and they had never come again, at least not with the samesplendour, even though Gregor had later earned so much that he wasin a position to bear the costs of the whole family, and did bearthem.  They had even got used to it, both Gregor and the family,they took the money with gratitude and he was glad to provide it,although there was no longer much warm affection given in return.Gregor only remained close to his sister now.  Unlike him, she was
[FRANZ KAFKA]very fond of music and a gifted and expressive violinist, it was hissecret plan to send her to the conservatory next year even though itwould cause great expense that would have to be made up for in someother way.  During Gregor's short periods in town, conversation withhis sister would often turn to the conservatory but it was only evermentioned as a lovely dream that could never be realised.  Theirparents did not like to hear this innocent talk, but Gregor thoughtabout it quite hard and decided he would let them know what heplanned with a grand announcement of it on Christmas day.That was the sort of totally pointless thing that went through hismind in his present state, pressed upright against the door andlistening.  There were times when he simply became too tired to
[FRANZ KAFKA][RELIEF]continue listening, when his head would fall wearily against thedoor and he would pull it up again with a start, as even theslightest noise he caused would be heard next door and they wouldall go silent.  [DIALOGUE]"What's that he's doing now", his father would sayafter a while, clearly having gone over to the door, and only thenwould the interrupted conversation slowly be taken up again.When explaining things, his father repeated himself several times,partly because it was a long time since he had been occupied withthese matters himself and partly because Gregor's mother did notunderstand everything the first time.  From these repeated explanationsGregor learned, to his pleasure, that despite all their misfortunesthere was still some money available from the old days.  It was not
[FRANZ KAFKA][SURPRISE][EMOTION][RELIEF][TRANSITION]a lot, but it had not been touched in the meantime and some interesthad accumulated.  Besides that, they had not been using up all themoney that Gregor had been bringing home every month, keeping only alittle for himself, so that that, too, had been accumulating.Behind the door, Gregor nodded with enthusiasm in his pleasure atthis unexpected thrift and caution.  He could actually have usedthis surplus money to reduce his father's debt to his boss, and theday when he could have freed himself from that job would have comemuch closer, but now it was certainly better the way his father haddone things.
[FRANZ KAFKA][PROBLEM][DANGER][CONFLICT][TRANSITION]This money, however, was certainly not enough to enable the familyto live off the interest; it was enough to maintain them for,perhaps, one or two years, no more.  That's to say, it was moneythat should not really be touched but set aside for emergencies;money to live on had to be earned.  His father was healthy but old,and lacking in self confidence.  During the five years that he hadnot been working - the first holiday in a life that had been full ofstrain and no success - he had put on a lot of weight and becomevery slow and clumsy.  Would Gregor's elderly mother now have to goand earn money? She suffered from asthma and it was a strain for her
[FRANZ KAFKA][CONFLICT][EMOTION]just to move about the home, every other day would be spentstruggling for breath on the sofa by the open window.  Would hissister have to go and earn money? She was still a child ofseventeen, her life up till then had been very enviable, consistingof wearing nice clothes, sleeping late, helping out in the business,joining in with a few modest pleasures and most of all playing theviolin.  Whenever they began to talk of the need to earn money,Gregor would always first let go of the door and then throw himselfonto the cool, leather sofa next to it, as he became quite hot withshame and regret.
[FRANZ KAFKA][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][METAPHOR][FLASHBACK][PERSPECTIVE][CONFLICT]He would often lie there the whole night through, not sleeping awink but scratching at the leather for hours on end.  Or he might goto all the effort of pushing a chair to the window, climbing up ontothe sill and, propped up in the chair, leaning on the window tostare out of it.  He had used to feel a great sense of freedom fromdoing this, but doing it now was obviously something more rememberedthan experienced,  as what he actually saw in this way was becomingless distinct every day, even things that were quite near; he hadused to curse the ever-present view of the hospital across thestreet, but now he could not see it at all, and if he had not knownthat he lived in Charlottenstrasse, which was a quiet street despitebeing in the middle of the city, he could have thought that he waslooking out the window at a barren waste where the grey sky and thegrey earth mingled inseparably.  His observant sister only needed tonotice the chair twice before she would always push it back to itsexact position by the window after she had tidied up the room, andeven left the inner pane of the window open from then on.
[FRANZ KAFKA][ACTION][PROBLEM][TRANSITION]If Gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank herfor all that she had to do for him it would have been easier for himto bear it; but as it was it caused him pain.  His sister,naturally, tried as far as possible to pretend there was nothingburdensome about it, and the longer it went on, of course, thebetter she was able to do so, but as time went by Gregor was alsoable to see through it all so much better.  It had even become veryunpleasant for him, now, whenever she entered the room.  No soonerhad she come in than she would quickly close the door as aprecaution so that no-one would have to suffer the view intoGregor's room, then she would go straight to the window and pull ithurriedly open almost as if she were suffocating.  Even if it was
[FRANZ KAFKA][TRANSITION]cold, she would stay at the window breathing deeply for a littlewhile.  She would alarm Gregor twice a day with this running aboutand noise making; he would stay under the couch shivering the wholewhile, knowing full well that she would certainly have liked tospare him this ordeal, but it was impossible for her to be in thesame room with him with the windows closed.One day, about a month after Gregor's transformation when his sisterno longer had any particular reason to be shocked at his appearance,she came into the room a little earlier than usual and found himstill staring out the window, motionless, and just where he would bemost horrible.  In itself, his sister's not coming into the roomwould have been no surprise for Gregor as it would have beendifficult for her to immediately open the window while he was stillthere, but not only did she not come in, she went straight back andclosed the door behind her, a stranger would have thought he hadthreatened her and tried to bite her.  Gregor went straight to hide
[FRANZ KAFKA][ACTION][TRANSITION]himself under the couch, of course, but he had to wait until middaybefore his sister came back and she seemed much more uneasy thanusual.  It made him realise that she still found his appearanceunbearable and would continue to do so, she probably even had toovercome the urge to flee when she saw the little bit of him thatprotruded from under the couch.  One day, in order to spare her eventhis sight, he spent four hours carrying the bedsheet over to thecouch on his back and arranged it so that he was completely coveredand his sister would not be able to see him even if she bent down.If she did not think this sheet was necessary then all she had to dowas take it off again, as it was clear enough that it was nopleasure for Gregor to cut himself off so completely.  She left the
[FRANZ KAFKA][FLASHBACK][EMOTION]sheet where it was.  Gregor even thought he glimpsed a look ofgratitude one time when he carefully looked out from under the sheetto see how his sister liked the new arrangement.For the first fourteen days, Gregor's parents could not bringthemselves to come into the room to see him.  He would often hearthem say how they appreciated all the new work his sister was doingeven though, before, they had seen her as a girl who was somewhatuseless and frequently been annoyed with her.  But now the two of
[FRANZ KAFKA][CONFLICT]them, father and mother, would often both wait outside the door ofGregor's room while his sister tidied up in there, and as soon asshe went out again she would have to tell them exactly howeverything looked, what Gregor had eaten, how he had behaved thistime and whether, perhaps, any slight improvement could be seen.His mother also wanted to go in and visit Gregor relatively soon buthis father and sister at first persuaded her against it.  Gregorlistened very closely to all this, and approved fully.  Later,though, she had to be held back by force, which made her call out:"Let me go and see Gregor, he is my unfortunate son! Can't you
[FRANZ KAFKA]understand I have to see him?", and Gregor would think to himselfthat maybe it would be better if his mother came in, not every dayof course, but one day a week, perhaps; she could understandeverything much better than his sister who, for all her courage, wasstill just a child after all, and really might not have had anadult's appreciation of the burdensome job she had taken on.Gregor's wish to see his mother was soon realised.  Out ofconsideration for his parents, Gregor wanted to avoid being seen atthe window during the day, the few square meters of the floor didnot give him much room to crawl about, it was hard to just liequietly through the night, his food soon stopped giving him anypleasure at all, and so, to entertain himself, he got into the habitof crawling up and down the walls and ceiling.  He was especially
[FRANZ KAFKA]fond of hanging from the ceiling; it was quite different from lyingon the floor; he could breathe more freely; his body had a lightswing to it; and up there, relaxed and almost happy, it might happenthat he would surprise even himself by letting go of the ceiling andlanding on the floor with a crash.  But now, of course, he had farbetter control of his body than before and, even with a fall asgreat as that, caused himself no damage.  Very soon his sisternoticed Gregor's new way of entertaining himself - he had, afterall, left traces of the adhesive from his feet as he crawled about -and got it into her head to make it as easy as possible for him byremoving the furniture that got in his way, especially the chest ofdrawers and the desk.  Now, this was not something that she would beable to do by herself; she did not dare to ask for help from herfather; the sixteen year old maid had carried on bravely since thecook had left but she certainly would not have helped in this, shehad even asked to be allowed to keep the kitchen locked at all timesand never to have to open the door unless it was especiallyimportant; so his sister had no choice but to choose some time whenGregor's father was not there and fetch his mother to help her.  As
[FRANZ KAFKA][EMOTION][TRANSITION]she approached the room, Gregor could hear his mother express herjoy, but once at the door she went silent.  First, of course, hissister came in and looked round to see that everything in the roomwas alright; and only then did she let her mother enter.  Gregor hadhurriedly pulled the sheet down lower over the couch and put morefolds into it so that everything really looked as if it had justbeen thrown down by chance.  Gregor also refrained, this time, fromspying out from under the sheet; he gave up the chance to see hismother until later and was simply glad that she had come.  "You can
[FRANZ KAFKA][CONFLICT]come in, he can't be seen", said his sister, obviously leading herin by the hand.  The old chest of drawers was too heavy for a pairof feeble women to be heaving about, but Gregor listened as theypushed it from its place, his sister always taking on the heaviestpart of the work for herself and ignoring her mother's warnings thatshe would strain herself.  This lasted a very long time.  Afterlabouring at it for fifteen minutes or more his mother said it wouldbe better to leave the chest where it was, for one thing it was tooheavy for them to get the job finished before Gregor's father gothome and leaving it in the middle of the room it would be in his wayeven more, and for another thing it wasn't even sure that taking thefurniture away would really be any help to him.  She thought just
[FRANZ KAFKA][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][EMOTION][PROBLEM][METAPHOR]the opposite; the sight of the bare walls saddened her right to herheart; and why wouldn't Gregor feel the same way about it, he'd beenused to this furniture in his room for a long time and it would makehim feel abandoned to be in an empty room like that.  Then, quietly,almost whispering as if wanting Gregor (whose whereabouts she didnot know) to hear not even the tone of her voice, as she wasconvinced that he did not understand her words, she added [DIALOGUE]"and bytaking the furniture away, won't it seem like we're showing thatwe've given up all hope of improvement and we're abandoning him tocope for himself? I think it'd be best to leave the room exactly theway it was before so that when Gregor comes back to us again he'llfind everything unchanged and he'll be able to forget the time inbetween all the easier".Hearing these words from his mother made Gregor realise that thelack of any direct human communication, along with the monotonouslife led by the family during these two months, must have made himconfused - he could think of no other way of explaining to himselfwhy he had seriously wanted his room emptied out.  Had he really
[FRANZ KAFKA][CONFLICT]wanted to transform his room into a cave, a warm room fitted outwith the nice furniture he had inherited? That would have let himcrawl around unimpeded in any direction, but it would also have lethim quickly forget his past when he had still been human.  He hadcome very close to forgetting, and it had only been the voice of hismother, unheard for so long, that had shaken him out of it.  Nothingshould be removed; everything had to stay; he could not do withoutthe good influence the furniture had on his condition; and if thefurniture made it difficult for him to crawl about mindlessly thatwas not a loss but a great advantage.
[FRANZ KAFKA][PERSPECTIVE][CONFLICT]His sister, unfortunately, did not agree; she had become used to theidea, not without reason, that she was Gregor's spokesman to hisparents about the things that concerned him.  This meant that hismother's advice now was sufficient reason for her to insist onremoving not only the chest of drawers and the desk, as she hadthought at first, but all the furniture apart from the all-importantcouch.  It was more than childish perversity, of course, or theunexpected confidence she had recently acquired, that made herinsist; she had indeed noticed that Gregor needed a lot of room tocrawl about in, whereas the furniture, as far as anyone could see,was of no use to him at all.  Girls of that age, though, do becomeenthusiastic about things and feel they must get their way wheneverthey can.  Perhaps this was what tempted Grete to make Gregor's
[FRANZ KAFKA][SURPRISE][DANGER][CONFLICT][PROBLEM]situation seem even more shocking than it was so that she could doeven more for him.  Grete would probably be the only one who woulddare enter a room dominated by Gregor crawling about the bare wallsby himself.So she refused to let her mother dissuade her.  Gregor's motheralready looked uneasy in his room, she soon stopped speaking andhelped Gregor's sister to get the chest of drawers out with whatstrength she had.  The chest of drawers was something that Gregor
[FRANZ KAFKA][CONFLICT]could do without if he had to, but the writing desk had to stay.Hardly had the two women pushed the chest of drawers, groaning, outof the room than Gregor poked his head out from under the couch tosee what he could do about it.  He meant to be as careful andconsiderate as he could, but, unfortunately, it was his mother whocame back first while Grete in the next room had her arms round thechest, pushing and pulling at it from side to side by herselfwithout, of course, moving it an inch.  His mother was not used tothe sight of Gregor, he might have made her ill, so Gregor hurriedbackwards to the far end of the couch.  In his startlement, though,
[FRANZ KAFKA][CONFLICT][DANGER]he was not able to prevent the sheet at its front from moving alittle.  It was enough to attract his mother's attention.  She stoodvery still, remained there a moment, and then went back out toGrete.Gregor kept trying to assure himself that nothing unusual washappening, it was just a few pieces of furniture being moved afterall, but he soon had to admit that the women going to and fro, theirlittle calls to each other, the scraping of the furniture on thefloor, all these things made him feel as if he were being assailedfrom all sides.  With his head and legs pulled in against him and
[FRANZ KAFKA][SURPRISE][EMOTION][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][DANGER][TRANSITION]his body pressed to the floor, he was forced to admit to himselfthat he could not stand all of this much longer.  They were emptyinghis room out; taking away everything that was dear to him; they hadalready taken out the chest containing his fretsaw and other tools;now they threatened to remove the writing desk with its placeclearly worn into the floor, the desk where he had done his homeworkas a business trainee, at high school, even while he had been atinfant school--he really could not wait any longer to see whetherthe two women's intentions were good.  He had nearly forgotten theywere there anyway, as they were now too tired to say anything whilethey worked and he could only hear their feet as they steppedheavily on the floor.So, while the women were leant against the desk in the other roomcatching their breath, he sallied out, changed direction four timesnot knowing what he should save first before his attention wassuddenly caught by the picture on the wall - which was alreadydenuded of everything else that had been on it - of the lady dressedin copious fur.  He hurried up onto the picture and pressed himself
[FRANZ KAFKA][TRANSITION][EMOTION][PERSPECTIVE][PROBLEM][GORE]against its glass, it held him firmly and felt good on his hotbelly.  This picture at least, now totally covered by Gregor, wouldcertainly be taken away by no-one.  He turned his head to face thedoor into the living room so that he could watch the women when theycame back.They had not allowed themselves a long rest and came back quitesoon; Grete had put her arm around her mother and was nearlycarrying her.  [DIALOGUE]"What shall we take now, then?", said Grete and
[FRANZ KAFKA]looked around.  Her eyes met those of Gregor on the wall.  Perhapsonly because her mother was there, she remained calm, bent her faceto her so that she would not look round and said, albeit hurriedlyand with a tremor in her voice: [DIALOGUE]"Come on, let's go back in theliving room for a while?"  Gregor could see what Grete had in mind,she wanted to take her mother somewhere safe and then chase him downfrom the wall.  Well, she could certainly try it! He sat unyielding
[FRANZ KAFKA][EMOTION][SURPRISE][GORE]on his picture.  He would rather jump at Grete's face.But Grete's words had made her mother quite worried, she stepped toone side, saw the enormous brown patch against the flowers of thewallpaper, and before she even realised it was Gregor that she sawscreamed: [DIALOGUE]"Oh God, oh God!"  Arms outstretched, she fell onto thecouch as if she had given up everything and stayed there immobile.[DIALOGUE]"Gregor!" shouted his sister, glowering at him and shaking her fist. That was the first word she had spoken to him directly since histransformation.  She ran into the other room to fetch some kind of
[FRANZ KAFKA]smelling salts to bring her mother out of her faint; Gregor wantedto help too - he could save his picture later, although he stuckfast to the glass and had to pull himself off by force; then he,too, ran into the next room as if he could advise his sister like inthe old days; but he had to just stand behind her doing nothing; shewas looking into various bottles, he startled her when she turnedround; a bottle fell to the ground and broke; a splinter cutGregor's face, some kind of caustic medicine splashed all over him;now, without delaying any longer, Grete took hold of all the bottlesshe could and ran with them in to her mother; she slammed the doorshut with her foot.  So now Gregor was shut out from his mother,who, because of him, might be near to death; he could not open thedoor if he did not want to chase his sister away, and she had tostay with his mother; there was nothing for him to do but wait; and,oppressed with anxiety and self-reproach, he began to crawl about,he crawled over everything, walls, furniture, ceiling, and finallyin his confusion as the whole room began to spin around him he felldown into the middle of the dinner table.He lay there for a while, numb and immobile, all around him it wasquiet, maybe that was a good sign.  Then there was someone at thedoor.  The maid, of course, had locked herself in her kitchen so
[FRANZ KAFKA]that Grete would have to go and answer it.  His father had arrivedhome.  [DIALOGUE]"What's happened?" were his first words; Grete's appearancemust have made everything clear to him.  She answered him withsubdued voice, and openly pressed her face into his chest: [DIALOGUE]"Mother'sfainted, but she's better now.  Gregor got out."  [DIALOGUE]"Just as Iexpected", said his father, [DIALOGUE]"just as I always said, but you womenwouldn't listen, would you."  It was clear to Gregor that Grete hadnot said enough and that his father took it to mean that somethingbad had happened, that he was responsible for some act of violence.
[FRANZ KAFKA]That meant Gregor would now have to try to calm his father, as hedid not have the time to explain things to him even if that had beenpossible.  So he fled to the door of his room and pressed himselfagainst it so that his father, when he came in from the hall, couldsee straight away that Gregor had the best intentions and would goback into his room without delay, that it would not be necessary todrive him back but that they had only to open the door and he woulddisappear.His father, though, was not in the mood to notice subtleties likethat; [DIALOGUE]"Ah!", he shouted as he came in, sounding as if he were bothangry and glad at the same time.  Gregor drew his head back from thedoor and lifted it towards his father.  He really had not imagined
[FRANZ KAFKA]his father the way he stood there now; of late, with his new habitof crawling about, he had neglected to pay attention to what wasgoing on the rest of the flat the way he had done before.  He reallyought to have expected things to have changed, but still, still, wasthat really his father? The same tired man as used to be layingthere entombed in his bed when Gregor came back from his businesstrips, who would receive him sitting in the armchair in hisnightgown when he came back in the evenings; who was hardly evenable to stand up but, as a sign of his pleasure, would just raisehis arms and who, on the couple of times a year when they went for awalk together on a Sunday or public holiday wrapped up tightly inhis overcoat between Gregor and his mother, would always labour hisway forward a little more slowly than them, who were already walkingslowly for his sake; who would place his stick down carefully and,if he wanted to say something would invariably stop and gather hiscompanions around him.  He was standing up straight enough now;dressed in a smart blue uniform with gold buttons, the sort worn bythe employees at the banking institute; above the high, stiff collarof the coat his strong double-chin emerged; under the bushyeyebrows, his piercing, dark eyes looked out fresh and alert; hisnormally unkempt white hair was combed down painfully close to hisscalp.  He took his cap, with its gold monogram from, probably, some
[FRANZ KAFKA][GORE]bank, and threw it in an arc right across the room onto the sofa,put his hands in his trouser pockets, pushing back the bottom of hislong uniform coat, and, with look of determination, walked towardsGregor.  He probably did not even know himself what he had in mind,but nonetheless lifted his feet unusually high.  Gregor was amazedat the enormous size of the soles of his boots, but wasted no timewith that - he knew full well, right from the first day of his newlife, that his father thought it necessary to always be extremelystrict with him.  And so he ran up to his father, stopped when hisfather stopped, scurried forwards again when he moved, evenslightly.  In this way they went round the room several times
[FRANZ KAFKA][PROBLEM][DANGER]without anything decisive happening, without even giving theimpression of a chase as everything went so slowly.  Gregor remainedall this time on the floor, largely because he feared his fathermight see it as especially provoking if he fled onto the wall orceiling.  Whatever he did, Gregor had to admit that he certainlywould not be able to keep up this running about for long, as foreach step his father took he had to carry out countless movements.He became noticeably short of breath, even in his earlier life hislungs had not been very reliable.  Now, as he lurched about in his
[FRANZ KAFKA][CONFLICT][DANGER][SURPRISE]efforts to muster all the strength he could for running he couldhardly keep his eyes open; his thoughts became too slow for him tothink of any other way of saving himself than running; he almostforgot that the walls were there for him to use although, here, theywere concealed behind carefully carved furniture full of notches andprotrusions - then, right beside him, lightly tossed, something flewdown and rolled in front of him.  It was an apple; then another oneimmediately flew at him; Gregor froze in shock; there was no longerany point in running as his father had decided to bombard him.  Hehad filled his pockets with fruit from the bowl on the sideboard andnow, without even taking the time for careful aim, threw one appleafter another.  These little, red apples rolled about on the floor,knocking into each other as if they had electric motors.  An apple
[FRANZ KAFKA][DANGER]thrown without much force glanced against Gregor's back and slid offwithout doing any harm.  Another one however, immediately followingit, hit squarely and lodged in his back; Gregor wanted to draghimself away, as if he could remove the surprising, the incrediblepain by changing his position; but he felt as if nailed to the spotand spread himself out, all his senses in confusion.  The last thinghe saw was the door of his room being pulled open, his sister wasscreaming, his mother ran out in front of her in her blouse (as hissister had taken off some of her clothes after she had fainted tomake it easier for her to breathe), she ran to his father, herskirts unfastened and sliding one after another to the ground,stumbling over the skirts she pushed herself to his father, her armsaround him, uniting herself with him totally - now Gregor lost hisability to see anything - her hands behind his father's head begginghim to spare Gregor's life.IIINo-one dared to remove the apple lodged in Gregor's flesh, so itremained there as a visible reminder of his injury.  He had suffered
[FRANZ KAFKA][PERSPECTIVE][TRANSITION][CONTEXT]it there for more than a month, and his condition seemed seriousenough to remind even his father that Gregor, despite his currentsad and revolting form, was a family member who could not be treatedas an enemy.  On the contrary, as a family there was a duty toswallow any revulsion for him and to be patient, just to be patient.Because of his injuries, Gregor had lost much of his mobility -probably permanently.  He had been reduced to the condition of anancient invalid and it took him long, long minutes to crawl acrosshis room - crawling over the ceiling was out of the question - butthis deterioration in his condition was fully (in his opinion) madeup for by the door to the living room being left open every evening.
[FRANZ KAFKA][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK][PERSPECTIVE][GORE] He got into the habit of closely watching it for one or two hoursbefore it was opened and then, lying in the darkness of his roomwhere he could not be seen from the living room, he could watch thefamily in the light of the dinner table and listen to theirconversation - with everyone's permission, in a way, and thus quitedifferently from before.They no longer held the lively conversations of earlier times, ofcourse, the ones that Gregor always thought about with longing whenhe was tired and getting into the damp bed in some small hotel room. All of them were usually very quiet nowadays.  Soon after dinner,his father would go to sleep in his chair; his mother and sisterwould urge each other to be quiet; his mother, bent deeply under thelamp, would sew fancy underwear for a fashion shop; his sister, whohad taken a sales job, learned shorthand and French in the eveningsso that she might be able to get a better position later on.
[FRANZ KAFKA]Sometimes his father would wake up and say to Gregor's mother[DIALOGUE]"you're doing so much sewing again today!", as if he did not knowthat he had been dozing - and then he would go back to sleep againwhile mother and sister would exchange a tired grin.With a kind of stubbornness, Gregor's father refused to take hisuniform off even at home; while his nightgown hung unused on its pegGregor's father would slumber where he was, fully dressed, as ifalways ready to serve and expecting to hear the voice of hissuperior even here.  The uniform had not been new to start with, butas a result of this it slowly became even shabbier despite theefforts of Gregor's mother and sister to look after it.  Gregorwould often spend the whole evening looking at all the stains onthis coat, with its gold buttons always kept polished and shiny,while the old man in it would sleep, highly uncomfortable butpeaceful.
[FRANZ KAFKA][GORE]As soon as it struck ten, Gregor's mother would speak gently to hisfather to wake him and try to persuade him to go to bed, as hecouldn't sleep properly where he was and he really had to get hissleep if he was to be up at six to get to work.  But since he hadbeen in work he had become more obstinate and would always insist onstaying longer at the table, even though he regularly fell asleepand it was then harder than ever to persuade him to exchange thechair for his bed.  Then, however much mother and sister wouldimportune him with little reproaches and warnings he would keepslowly shaking his head for a quarter of an hour with his eyesclosed and refusing to get up.  Gregor's mother would tug at hissleeve, whisper endearments into his ear, Gregor's sister wouldleave her work to help her mother, but nothing would have any effecton him.  He would just sink deeper into his chair.  Only when the
[FRANZ KAFKA]two women took him under the arms he would abruptly open his eyes,look at them one after the other and say: [DIALOGUE]"What a life! This is whatpeace I get in my old age!"  And supported by the two women he wouldlift himself up carefully as if he were carrying the greatest loadhimself, let the women take him to the door, send them off and carryon by himself while Gregor's mother would throw down her needle andhis sister her pen so that they could run after his father andcontinue being of help to him.Who, in this tired and overworked family, would have had time togive more attention to Gregor than was absolutely necessary? Thehousehold budget became even smaller; so now the maid was dismissed;an enormous, thick-boned charwoman with white hair that flappedaround her head came every morning and evening to do the heaviestwork; everything else was looked after by Gregor's mother on top ofthe large amount of sewing work she did.  Gregor even learned,listening to the evening conversation about what price they hadhoped for, that several items of jewellery belonging to the familyhad been sold, even though both mother and sister had been very fondof wearing them at functions and celebrations.  But the loudest
[FRANZ KAFKA][CONFLICT][EMOTION][PROBLEM][SURPRISE]complaint was that although the flat was much too big for theirpresent circumstances, they could not move out of it, there was noimaginable way of transferring Gregor to the new address.  He couldsee quite well, though, that there were more reasons thanconsideration for him that made it difficult for them to move, itwould have been quite easy to transport him in any suitable cratewith a few air holes in it; the main thing holding the family backfrom their decision to move was much more to do with their totaldespair, and the thought that they had been struck with a misfortuneunlike anything experienced by anyone else they knew or were relatedto.  They carried out absolutely everything that the world expectsfrom poor people, Gregor's father brought bank employees theirbreakfast, his mother sacrificed herself by washing clothes forstrangers, his sister ran back and forth behind her desk at thebehest of the customers, but they just did not have the strength todo any more.  And the injury in Gregor's back began to hurt as muchas when it was new.  After they had come back from taking his father
[FRANZ KAFKA]to bed Gregor's mother and sister would now leave their work whereit was and sit close together, cheek to cheek; his mother wouldpoint to Gregor's room and say [DIALOGUE]"Close that door, Grete", and then,when he was in the dark again, they would sit in the next room andtheir tears would mingle, or they would simply sit there staringdry-eyed at the table.Gregor hardly slept at all, either night or day.  Sometimes he wouldthink of taking over the family's affairs, just like before, thenext time the door was opened; he had long forgotten about his bossand the chief clerk, but they would appear again in his thoughts,the salesmen and the apprentices, that stupid teaboy, two or threefriends from other businesses, one of the chambermaids from aprovincial hotel, a tender memory that appeared and disappearedagain, a cashier from a hat shop for whom his attention had beenserious but too slow, - all of them appeared to him, mixed togetherwith strangers and others he had forgotten, but instead of helpinghim and his family they were all of them inaccessible, and he wasglad when they disappeared.  Other times he was not at all in themood to look after his family, he was filled with simple rage aboutthe lack of attention he was shown, and although he could think ofnothing he would have wanted, he made plans of how he could get intothe pantry where he could take all the things he was entitled to,even if he was not hungry.  Gregor's sister no longer thought about
[FRANZ KAFKA][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][ACTION][GORE]how she could please him but would hurriedly push some food or otherinto his room with her foot before she rushed out to work in themorning and at midday, and in the evening she would sweep it awayagain with the broom, indifferent as to whether it had been eaten or- more often than not - had been left totally untouched.  She stillcleared up the room in the evening, but now she could not have beenany quicker about it.  Smears of dirt were left on the walls, hereand there were little balls of dust and filth.  At first, Gregorwent into one of the worst of these places when his sister arrivedas a reproach to her, but he could have stayed there for weekswithout his sister doing anything about it; she could see the dirtas well as he could but she had simply decided to leave him to it.
[FRANZ KAFKA][CONFLICT]At the same time she became touchy in a way that was quite new forher and which everyone in the family understood - cleaning upGregor's room was for her and her alone.  Gregor's mother did oncethoroughly clean his room, and needed to use several bucketfuls ofwater to do it - although that much dampness also made Gregor illand he lay flat on the couch, bitter and immobile.  But his motherwas to be punished still more for what she had done, as hardly hadhis sister arrived home in the evening than she noticed the changein Gregor's room and, highly aggrieved, ran back into the livingroom where, despite her mothers raised and imploring hands, shebroke into convulsive tears.  Her father, of course, was startledout of his chair and the two parents looked on astonished andhelpless; then they, too, became agitated; Gregor's father, standingto the right of his mother, accused her of not leaving the cleaningof Gregor's room to his sister; from her left, Gregor's sisterscreamed at her that she was never to clean Gregor's room again;while his mother tried to draw his father, who was beside himselfwith anger, into the bedroom; his sister, quaking with tears,thumped on the table with her small fists; and Gregor hissed inanger that no-one had even thought of closing the door to save himthe sight of this and all its noise.
[FRANZ KAFKA][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][CHARACTER][METAPHOR][PERSPECTIVE]Gregor's sister was exhausted from going out to work, and lookingafter Gregor as she had done before was even more work for her, buteven so his mother ought certainly not to have taken her place.Gregor, on the other hand, ought not to be neglected.  Now, though,the charwoman was here.  This elderly widow, with a robust bonestructure that made her able to withstand the hardest of things inher long life, wasn't really repelled by Gregor.  Just by chance one
[FRANZ KAFKA][SURPRISE]day, rather than any real curiosity, she opened the door to Gregor'sroom and found herself face to face with him.  He was taken totallyby surprise, no-one was chasing him but he began to rush to and frowhile she just stood there in amazement with her hands crossed infront of her.  From then on she never failed to open the doorslightly every evening and morning and look briefly in on him.  Atfirst she would call to him as she did so with words that sheprobably considered friendly, such as [DIALOGUE]"come on then, you olddung-beetle!", or [DIALOGUE]"look at the old dung-beetle there!"  Gregor neverresponded to being spoken to in that way, but just remained where hewas without moving as if the door had never even been opened.  If
[FRANZ KAFKA][TRANSITION][ACTION][CONFLICT][SURPRISE]only they had told this charwoman to clean up his room every dayinstead of letting her disturb him for no reason whenever she feltlike it! One day, early in the morning while a heavy rain struck thewindowpanes, perhaps indicating that spring was coming, she began tospeak to him in that way once again.  Gregor was so resentful of itthat he started to move toward her, he was slow and infirm, but itwas like a kind of attack.  Instead of being afraid, the charwomanjust lifted up one of the chairs from near the door and stood therewith her mouth open, clearly intending not to close her mouth untilthe chair in her hand had been slammed down into Gregor's back.
[FRANZ KAFKA][TRANSITION][DIALOGUE]"Aren't you coming any closer, then?", she asked when Gregor turnedround again, and she calmly put the chair back in the corner.Gregor had almost entirely stopped eating.  Only if he happened tofind himself next to the food that had been prepared for him hemight take some of it into his mouth to play with it, leave it therea few hours and then, more often than not, spit it out again.  Atfirst he thought it was distress at the state of his room thatstopped him eating, but he had soon got used to the changes madethere.  They had got into the habit of putting things into this room
[FRANZ KAFKA][PROBLEM]that they had no room for anywhere else, and there were now manysuch things as one of the rooms in the flat had been rented out tothree gentlemen.  These earnest gentlemen - all three of them hadfull beards, as Gregor learned peering through the crack in the doorone day - were painfully insistent on things' being tidy.  Thismeant not only in their own room but, since they had taken a room inthis establishment, in the entire flat and especially in thekitchen.  Unnecessary clutter was something they could not tolerate,especially if it was dirty.  They had moreover brought most of their
[FRANZ KAFKA][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][ACTION][METAPHOR][PROBLEM]own furnishings and equipment with them.  For this reason, manythings had become superfluous which, although they could not besold, the family did not wish to discard.  All these things foundtheir way into Gregor's room.  The dustbins from the kitchen foundtheir way in there too.  The charwoman was always in a hurry, and
[FRANZ KAFKA][SURPRISE][EMOTION][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][DEATH]anything she couldn't use for the time being she would just chuck inthere.  He, fortunately, would usually see no more than the objectand the hand that held it.  The woman most likely meant to fetch thethings back out again when she had time and the opportunity, or tothrow everything out in one go, but what actually happened was thatthey were left where they landed when they had first been thrownunless Gregor made his way through the junk and moved it somewhereelse.  At first he moved it because, with no other room free wherehe could crawl about, he was forced to, but later on he came toenjoy it although moving about in that way left him sad and tired todeath, and he would remain immobile for hours afterwards.
[FRANZ KAFKA][TRANSITION]The gentlemen who rented the room would sometimes take their eveningmeal at home in the living room that was used by everyone, and sothe door to this room was often kept closed in the evening.  ButGregor found it easy to give up having the door open, he had, afterall, often failed to make use of it when it was open and, withoutthe family having noticed it, lain in his room in its darkestcorner.  One time, though, the charwoman left the door to the livingroom slightly open, and it remained open when the gentlemen whorented the room came in in the evening and the light was put on.They sat up at the table where, formerly, Gregor had taken his mealswith his father and mother, they unfolded the serviettes and pickedup their knives and forks.  Gregor's mother immediately appeared in
[FRANZ KAFKA][EMOTION][ACTION]the doorway with a dish of meat and soon behind her came his sisterwith a dish piled high with potatoes.  The food was steaming, andfilled the room with its smell.  The gentlemen bent over the dishesset in front of them as if they wanted to test the food beforeeating it, and the gentleman in the middle, who seemed to count asan authority for the other two, did indeed cut off a piece of meatwhile it was still in its dish, clearly wishing to establish whetherit was sufficiently cooked or whether it should be sent back to thekitchen.  It was to his satisfaction, and Gregor's mother andsister, who had been looking on anxiously, began to breathe againand smiled.
[FRANZ KAFKA]The family themselves ate in the kitchen.  Nonetheless, Gregor'sfather came into the living room before he went into the kitchen,bowed once with his cap in his hand and did his round of the table.The gentlemen stood as one, and mumbled something into their beards. Then, once they were alone, they ate in near perfect silence.  It
[FRANZ KAFKA]seemed remarkable to Gregor that above all the various noises ofeating their chewing teeth could still be heard, as if they hadwanted to show Gregor that you need teeth in order to eat and it wasnot possible to perform anything with jaws that are toothlesshowever nice they might be.  [DIALOGUE]"I'd like to eat something", saidGregor anxiously, [DIALOGUE]"but not anything like they're eating.  They dofeed themselves.  And here I am, dying!"Throughout all this time, Gregor could not remember having heard theviolin being played, but this evening it began to be heard from thekitchen.  The three gentlemen had already finished their meal, theone in the middle had produced a newspaper, given a page to each ofthe others, and now they leant back in their chairs reading them andsmoking.  When the violin began playing they became attentive, stoodup and went on tip-toe over to the door of the hallway where theystood pressed against each other.  Someone must have heard them in
[FRANZ KAFKA][CONFLICT]the kitchen, as Gregor's father called out: [DIALOGUE]"Is the playing perhapsunpleasant for the gentlemen? We can stop it straight away."  [DIALOGUE]"Onthe contrary", said the middle gentleman, [DIALOGUE]"would the young lady notlike to come in and play for us here in the room, where it is, afterall, much more cosy and comfortable?"  [DIALOGUE]"Oh yes, we'd love to",called back Gregor's father as if he had been the violin playerhimself.  The gentlemen stepped back into the room and waited.Gregor's father soon appeared with the music stand, his mother withthe music and his sister with the violin.  She calmly preparedeverything for her to begin playing; his parents, who had neverrented a room out before and therefore showed an exaggeratedcourtesy towards the three gentlemen, did not even dare to sit ontheir own chairs; his father leant against the door with his righthand pushed in between two buttons on his uniform coat; his mother,though, was offered a seat by one of the gentlemen and sat - leavingthe chair where the gentleman happened to have placed it - out ofthe way in a corner.
[FRANZ KAFKA]His sister began to play; father and mother paid close attention,one on each side, to the movements of her hands.  Drawn in by theplaying, Gregor had dared to come forward a little and already hadhis head in the living room.  Before, he had taken great pride inhow considerate he was but now it hardly occurred to him that he hadbecome so thoughtless about the others.  What's more, there was nowall the more reason to keep himself hidden as he was covered in thedust that lay everywhere in his room and flew up at the slightestmovement; he carried threads, hairs, and remains of food about onhis back and sides; he was much too indifferent to everything now tolay on his back and wipe himself on the carpet like he had used todo several times a day.  And despite this condition, he was not too
[FRANZ KAFKA]shy to move forward a little onto the immaculate floor of the livingroom.No-one noticed him, though.  The family was totally preoccupied withthe violin playing; at first, the three gentlemen had put theirhands in their pockets and come up far too close behind the musicstand to look at all the notes being played, and they must havedisturbed Gregor's sister, but soon, in contrast with the family,they  withdrew back to the window with their heads sunk and talkingto each other at half volume, and they stayed by the window whileGregor's father observed them anxiously.  It really now seemed veryobvious that they had expected to hear some beautiful orentertaining violin playing but had been disappointed, that they hadhad enough of the whole performance and it was only now out ofpoliteness that they allowed their peace to be disturbed.  It was
[FRANZ KAFKA][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][SUSPENSE]especially unnerving, the way they all blew the smoke from theircigarettes upwards from their mouth and noses.  Yet Gregor's sisterwas playing so beautifully.  Her face was leant to one side,following the lines of music with a careful and melancholyexpression.  Gregor crawled a little further forward, keeping hishead close to the ground so that he could meet her eyes if thechance came.  Was he an animal if music could captivate him so? It
[FRANZ KAFKA][CONFLICT][SURPRISE]seemed to him that he was being shown the way to the unknownnourishment he had been yearning for.  He was determined to make hisway forward to his sister and tug at her skirt to show her she mightcome into his room with her violin, as no-one appreciated herplaying here as much as he would.  He never wanted to let her out ofhis room, not while he lived, anyway; his shocking appearanceshould, for once, be of some use to him; he wanted to be at everydoor of his room at once to hiss and spit at the attackers; hissister should not be forced to stay with him, though, but stay ofher own free will; she would sit beside him on the couch with herear bent down to him while he told her how he had always intended tosend her to the conservatory, how he would have told everyone aboutit last Christmas - had Christmas really come and gone already? - ifthis misfortune hadn't got in the way, and refuse to let anyonedissuade him from it.  On hearing all this, his sister would break
[FRANZ KAFKA]out in tears of emotion, and Gregor would climb up to her shoulderand kiss her neck, which, since she had been going out to work, shehad kept free without any necklace or collar.[DIALOGUE]"Mr. Samsa!", shouted the middle gentleman to Gregor's father,pointing, without wasting any more words, with his forefinger atGregor as he slowly moved forward.  The violin went silent, themiddle of the three gentlemen first smiled at his two friends,shaking his head, and then looked back at Gregor.  His father seemedto think it more important to calm the three gentlemen beforedriving Gregor out, even though they were not at all upset andseemed to think Gregor was more entertaining than the violin playinghad been.  He rushed up to them with his arms spread out andattempted to drive them back into their room at the same time astrying to block their view of Gregor with his body.  Now they did
[FRANZ KAFKA][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][SURPRISE]become a little annoyed, and it was not clear whether it was hisfather's behaviour that annoyed them or the dawning realisation thatthey had had a neighbour like Gregor in the next room withoutknowing it.  They asked Gregor's father for explanations, raisedtheir arms like he had, tugged excitedly at their beards and movedback towards their room only very slowly.  Meanwhile Gregor's sisterhad overcome the despair she had fallen into when her playing wassuddenly interrupted.  She had let her hands drop and let violin andbow hang limply for a while but continued to look at the music as ifstill playing, but then she suddenly pulled herself together, laythe instrument on her mother's lap who still sat laboriouslystruggling for breath where she was, and ran into the next roomwhich, under pressure from her father, the three gentlemen were morequickly moving toward.  Under his sister's experienced hand, the
[FRANZ KAFKA]pillows and covers on the beds flew up and were put into order andshe had already finished making the beds and slipped out againbefore the three gentlemen had reached the room.  Gregor's fatherseemed so obsessed with what he was doing that he forgot all therespect he owed to his tenants.  He urged them and pressed themuntil, when he was already at the door of the room, the middle ofthe three gentlemen shouted like thunder and stamped his foot andthereby brought Gregor's father to a halt.  [DIALOGUE]"I declare here andnow", he said, raising his hand and glancing at Gregor's mother andsister to gain their attention too, [DIALOGUE]"that with regard to therepugnant conditions that prevail in this flat and with this family"- here he looked briefly but decisively at the floor - "I giveimmediate notice on my room.  For the days that I have been living
[FRANZ KAFKA]here I will, of course, pay nothing at all, on the contrary I willconsider whether to proceed with some kind of action for damagesfrom you, and believe me it would be very easy to set out thegrounds for such an action.[DIALOGUE]"  He was silent and looked straightahead as if waiting for something.  And indeed, his two friendsjoined in with the words: "And we also give immediate notice."  Withthat, he took hold of the door handle and slammed the door.Gregor's father staggered back to his seat, feeling his way with hishands, and fell into it; it looked as if he was stretching himselfout for his usual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way his headkept nodding it could be seen that he was not sleeping at all.
[FRANZ KAFKA][EMOTION][CONFLICT]Throughout all this, Gregor had lain still where the three gentlemenhad first seen him.  His disappointment at the failure of his plan,and perhaps also because he was weak from hunger, made it impossiblefor him to move.  He was sure that everyone would turn on him anymoment, and he waited.  He was not even startled out of this statewhen the violin on his mother's lap fell from her trembling fingersand landed loudly on the floor.
[FRANZ KAFKA][DIALOGUE]"Father, Mother", said his sister, hitting the table with her handas introduction, [DIALOGUE]"we can't carry on like this.  Maybe you can't seeit, but I can.  I don't want to call this monster my brother, all Ican say is: we have to try and get rid of it.  We've done all that'shumanly possible to look after it and be patient, I don't thinkanyone could accuse us of doing anything wrong."[DIALOGUE]"She's absolutely right", said Gregor's father to himself.  Hismother, who still had not had time to catch her breath, began tocough dully, her hand held out in front of her and a derangedexpression in her eyes.Gregor's sister rushed to his mother and put her hand on herforehead.  Her words seemed to give Gregor's father some moredefinite ideas.  He sat upright, played with his uniform cap between
[FRANZ KAFKA]the plates left by the three gentlemen after their meal, andoccasionally looked down at Gregor as he lay there immobile.[DIALOGUE]"We have to try and get rid of it", said Gregor's sister, nowspeaking only to her father, as her mother was too occupied withcoughing to listen, [DIALOGUE]"it'll be the death of both of you, I can see itcoming.  We can't all work as hard as we have to and then come hometo be tortured like this, we can't endure it.  I can't endure it anymore."  And she broke out so heavily in tears that they flowed downthe face of her mother, and she wiped them away with mechanical handmovements.[DIALOGUE]"My child", said her father with sympathy and obvious understanding,[DIALOGUE]"what are we to do?"His sister just shrugged her shoulders as a sign of the helplessnessand tears that had taken hold of her, displacing her earliercertainty.
[FRANZ KAFKA][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][METAPHOR][DANGER][DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE]"If he could just understand us", said his father almost as aquestion; his sister shook her hand vigorously through her tears asa sign that of that there was no question."If he could just understand us", repeated Gregor's father, closinghis eyes in acceptance of his sister's certainty that that was quiteimpossible, [DIALOGUE]"then perhaps we could come to some kind of arrangementwith him.  But as it is ..."[DIALOGUE]"It's got to go", shouted his sister, "that's the only way, Father.You've got to get rid of the idea that that's Gregor.  We've onlyharmed ourselves by believing it for so long.  How can that beGregor? If it were Gregor he would have seen long ago that it's not
[FRANZ KAFKA][CONFLICT]possible for human beings to live with an animal like that and hewould have gone of his own free will.  We wouldn't have a brotherany more, then, but we could carry on with our lives and rememberhim with respect.  As it is this animal is persecuting us, it'sdriven out our tenants, it obviously wants to take over the wholeflat and force us to sleep on the streets.  Father, look, justlook[DIALOGUE]", she suddenly screamed, "he's starting again!"   In her alarm,which was totally beyond Gregor's comprehension, his sister evenabandoned his mother as she pushed herself vigorously out of herchair as if more willing to sacrifice her own mother than stayanywhere near Gregor.  She rushed over to behind her father, who had
[FRANZ KAFKA]become excited merely because she was and stood up half raising hishands in front of Gregor's sister as if to protect her.But Gregor had had no intention of frightening anyone, least of allhis sister.  All he had done was begin to turn round so that hecould go back into his room, although that was in itself quitestartling as his pain-wracked condition meant that turning roundrequired a great deal of effort and he was using his head to helphimself do it, repeatedly raising it and striking it against thefloor.  He stopped and looked round.  They seemed to have realised
[FRANZ KAFKA][EMOTION][CONFLICT]his good intention and had only been alarmed briefly.  Now they alllooked at him in unhappy silence.  His mother lay in her chair withher legs stretched out and pressed against each other, her eyesnearly closed with exhaustion; his sister sat next to his fatherwith her arms around his neck.[DIALOGUE]"Maybe now they'll let me turn round", thought Gregor and went backto work.  He could not help panting loudly with the effort and had
[FRANZ KAFKA][TRANSITION][SURPRISE]sometimes to stop and take a rest.  No-one was making him rush anymore, everything was left up to him.  As soon as he had finallyfinished turning round he began to move straight ahead.  He wasamazed at the great distance that separated him from his room, andcould not understand how he had covered that distance in his weakstate a little while before and almost without noticing it.  He
[FRANZ KAFKA]concentrated on crawling as fast as he could and hardly noticed thatthere was not a word, not any cry, from his family to distract him.He did not turn his head until he had reached the doorway.  He didnot turn it all the way round as he felt his neck becoming stiff,but it was nonetheless enough to see that nothing behind him hadchanged, only his sister had stood up.  With his last glance he sawthat his mother had now fallen completely asleep.
[FRANZ KAFKA][SURPRISE][DANGER][ACTION][CONFLICT][EMOTION]He was hardly inside his room before the door was hurriedly shut,bolted and locked.  The sudden noise behind Gregor so startled himthat his little legs collapsed under him.  It was his sister who hadbeen in so much of a rush.  She had been standing there waiting andsprung forward lightly, Gregor had not heard her coming at all, andas she turned the key in the lock she said loudly to her parents [DIALOGUE]"Atlast!".
[FRANZ KAFKA][PERSPECTIVE][DIALOGUE]"What now, then?", Gregor asked himself as he looked round in thedarkness.  He soon made the discovery that he could no longer moveat all.  This was no surprise to him, it seemed rather that beingable to actually move around on those spindly little legs until thenwas unnatural.  He also felt relatively comfortable.  It is true
[FRANZ KAFKA]that his entire body was aching, but the pain seemed to be slowlygetting weaker and weaker and would finally disappear altogether.He could already hardly feel the decayed apple in his back or theinflamed area around it, which was entirely covered in white dust.He thought back of his family with emotion and love.  If it waspossible, he felt that he must go away even more strongly than hissister.  He remained in this state of empty and peaceful rumination
[FRANZ KAFKA]until he heard the clock tower strike three in the morning.  Hewatched as it slowly began to get light everywhere outside thewindow too.  Then, without his willing it, his head sank downcompletely, and his last breath flowed weakly from his nostrils.When the cleaner came in early in the morning - they'd often askedher not to keep slamming the doors but with her strength and in herhurry she still did, so that everyone in the flat knew when she'darrived and from then on it was impossible to sleep in peace - shemade her usual brief look in on Gregor and at first found nothingspecial.  She thought he was laying there so still on purpose,
[FRANZ KAFKA][DEATH][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][MURDER]playing the martyr; she attributed all possible understanding tohim.  She happened to be holding the long broom in her hand, so shetried to tickle Gregor with it from the doorway.  When she had nosuccess with that she tried to make a nuisance of herself and pokedat him a little, and only when she found she could shove him acrossthe floor with no resistance at all did she start to pay attention.She soon realised what had really happened, opened her eyes wide,whistled to herself, but did not waste time to yank open the bedroomdoors and shout loudly into the darkness of the bedrooms: [DIALOGUE]"Come and'ave a look at this, it's dead, just lying there, stone dead!"Mr. and  Mrs. Samsa sat upright there in their marriage bed and hadto make an effort to get over the shock caused by the cleaner beforethey could grasp what she was saying.  But then, each from his own
[FRANZ KAFKA]side, they hurried out of bed.  Mr. Samsa threw the blanket over hisshoulders,  Mrs. Samsa just came out in her nightdress; and that ishow they went into Gregor's room.  On the way they opened the doorto the living room where Grete had been sleeping since the threegentlemen had moved in; she was fully dressed as if she had neverbeen asleep, and the paleness of her face seemed to confirm this.[DIALOGUE]"Dead?", asked  Mrs. Samsa, looking at the charwoman enquiringly,even though she could have checked for herself and could have knownit even without checking.  [DIALOGUE]"That's what I said",  replied thecleaner, and to prove it she gave Gregor's body another shove withthe broom, sending it sideways across the floor.  Mrs. Samsa made a
[FRANZ KAFKA]movement as if she wanted to hold back the broom, but did notcomplete it.  [DIALOGUE]"Now then", said  Mr. Samsa, [DIALOGUE]"let's give thanks to Godfor that". He crossed himself, and the three women followed hisexample.  Grete, who had not taken her eyes from the corpse, said:"Just look how thin he was.  He didn't eat anything for so long.
[FRANZ KAFKA]The food came out again just the same as when it went in[DIALOGUE]". Gregor'sbody was indeed completely dried up and flat, they had not seen ituntil then, but now he was not lifted up on his little legs, nor didhe do anything to make them look away."Grete, come with us in here for a little while", said  Mrs. Samsawith a pained smile, and Grete followed her parents into the bedroombut not without looking back at the body.  The cleaner shut the doorand opened the window wide.  Although it was still early in themorning the fresh air had something of warmth mixed in with it.  Itwas already the end of March, after all.
[FRANZ KAFKA]The three gentlemen stepped out of their room and looked round inamazement for their breakfasts;  they had been forgotten about.[DIALOGUE]"Where is our breakfast?", the middle gentleman asked the cleanerirritably.  She just put her finger on her lips and made a quick andsilent sign to the men that they might like to come into Gregor'sroom.  They did so, and stood around Gregor's corpse with theirhands in the pockets of their well-worn coats. It was now quitelight in the room.
[FRANZ KAFKA][EMOTION]Then the door of the bedroom opened and  Mr. Samsa appeared in hisuniform with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other.  Allof them had been crying a little; Grete now and then pressed herface against her father's arm.[DIALOGUE]"Leave my home.  Now!", said  Mr. Samsa, indicating the door andwithout letting the women from him.  [DIALOGUE]"What do you mean?", asked themiddle of the three gentlemen somewhat disconcerted, and he smiledsweetly.  The other two held their hands behind their backs andcontinually rubbed them together in gleeful anticipation of a loudquarrel which could only end in their favour.  "I mean just what I
[FRANZ KAFKA]said[DIALOGUE]", answered  Mr. Samsa, and, with his two companions, went in astraight line towards the man.  At first, he stood there still,looking at the ground as if the contents of his head wererearranging themselves into new positions.  "Alright, we'll gothen", he said, and looked up at  Mr. Samsa as if he had beensuddenly overcome with humility and wanted permission again fromMr. Samsa for his decision.  Mr. Samsa merely opened his eyes wideand briefly nodded to him several times.  At that, and without
[FRANZ KAFKA]delay, the man actually did take long strides into the fronthallway; his two friends had stopped rubbing their hands some timebefore and had been listening to what was being said.  Now theyjumped off after their friend as if taken with a sudden fear thatMr. Samsa might go into the hallway in front of them and break theconnection with their leader.  Once there, all three took their hatsfrom the stand, took their sticks from the holder, bowed without aword and left the premises.  Mr. Samsa and the two women followedthem out onto the landing; but they had had no reason to mistrustthe men's intentions and as they leaned over the landing they saw howthe three gentlemen made slow but steady progress down the manysteps.  As they turned the corner on each floor they disappeared and
[FRANZ KAFKA][TRANSITION]would reappear a few moments later; the further down they went, themore that the Samsa family lost interest in them; when a butcher'sboy, proud of posture with his tray on his head, passed them on hisway up and came nearer than they were,  Mr. Samsa and the women cameaway from the landing and went, as if relieved, back into the flat.They decided the best way to make use of that day was for relaxationand to go for a walk; not only had they earned a break from work butthey were in serious need of it.  So they sat at the table and wrotethree letters of excusal,  Mr. Samsa to his employers,  Mrs. Samsato her contractor and Grete to her principal.  The cleaner came inwhile they were writing to tell them she was going, she'd finishedher work for that morning.  The three of them at first just nodded
[FRANZ KAFKA][EMOTION]without looking up from what they were writing, and it was only whenthe cleaner still did not seem to want to leave that they looked upin irritation.  [DIALOGUE]"Well?", asked  Mr. Samsa.  The charwoman stood inthe doorway with a smile on her face as if she had some tremendousgood news to report, but would only do it if she was clearly askedto.  The almost vertical little ostrich feather on her hat, whichhad been a source of irritation to  Mr. Samsa all the time she hadbeen working for them, swayed gently in all directions.  [DIALOGUE]"What is ityou want then?", asked  Mrs. Samsa, whom the cleaner had the mostrespect for.  [DIALOGUE]"Yes", she answered, and broke into a friendly laugh
[FRANZ KAFKA]that made her unable to speak straight away, [DIALOGUE]"well then, that thingin there, you needn't worry about how you're going to get rid of it. That's all been sorted out."   Mrs. Samsa and Grete bent down overtheir letters as if intent on continuing with what they werewriting;  Mr. Samsa saw that the cleaner wanted to start describingeverything in detail but, with outstretched hand, he made it quiteclear that she was not to.  So, as she was prevented from tellingthem all about it, she suddenly remembered what a hurry she was inand, clearly peeved, called out [DIALOGUE]"Cheerio then, everyone", turnedround sharply and left, slamming the door terribly as she went.[DIALOGUE]"Tonight she gets sacked", said  Mr. Samsa, but he received no replyfrom either his wife or his daughter as the charwoman seemed to havedestroyed the peace they had only just gained.  They got up and wentover to the window where they remained with their arms around eachother.  Mr. Samsa twisted round in his chair to look at them and satthere watching for a while.  Then he called out: "Come here, then.
[FRANZ KAFKA][TRANSITION][ACTION][EMOTION]Let's forget about all that old stuff, shall we.  Come and give me abit of attention". The two women immediately did as he said,hurrying over to him where they kissed him and hugged him and thenthey quickly finished their letters.After that, the three of them left the flat together, which wassomething they had not done for months, and took the tram out to theopen country outside the town.  They had the tram, filled with warm
[FRANZ KAFKA]sunshine, all to themselves.  Leant back comfortably on their seats,they discussed their prospects and found that on closer examinationthey were not at all bad - until then they had never asked eachother about their work but all three had jobs which were very goodand held particularly good promise for the future.  The greatestimprovement for the time being, of course, would be achieved quiteeasily by moving house; what they needed now was a flat that wassmaller and cheaper than the current one which had been chosen byGregor, one that was in a better location and, most of all, morepractical.  All the time, Grete was becoming livelier.  With all the
[FRANZ KAFKA][TRANSITION][EMOTION]worry they had been having of late her cheeks had become pale, but,while they were talking,  Mr. and  Mrs. Samsa were struck, almostsimultaneously, with the thought of how their daughter wasblossoming into a well built and beautiful young lady.  They becamequieter.  Just from each other's glance and almost without knowingit they agreed that it would soon be time to find a good man forher.  And, as if in confirmation of their new dreams and goodintentions, as soon as they reached their destination Grete was thefirst to get up and stretch out her young body.
