As far as I can recollect, it was somewhat tothis effect: "Comfortable home offered to a gentleman (a bachelor) atmoderate terms in an elderly Highland lady's house at Pitlochry. Must
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CONFLICT][PERSPECTIVE][TRANSITION]be a strict teetotaller and non-smoker. F.M., Box so-and-so."
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][TRANSITION][EXPOSITION][METAPHOR][RELIEF][CHARACTER][CHARACTERIZATION]The naïveté and originality of the advertisement pleased me. The ideaof obtaining as a boarder a young man combining such virtues asabstinence from alcohol and tobacco amused me vastly. And then abachelor, too! Did she mean to make love to him herself? The sly old
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]thing! She took care to insert the epithet [DIALOGUE]"elderly," in order toavoid suspicion; and there was no doubt about it--she thirsted formatrimony. Being [DIALOGUE]"tabooed" by all the men who had even as much ascaught a passing glimpse of her, this was her last resource--she wouldentrap some unwary stranger, a man with money of course, and inveiglehim into marrying her. And there rose up before me visions of a tall,angular, forty-year-old Scottish spinster, with high cheek-bones,virulent, sandy hair, and brawny arms--the sort of woman that oughtnot to have been a woman at all--the sort that sets all my teeth onedge. Yet it was Pitlochry, heavenly Pitlochry, and there was no one
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][CONFLICT]else advertising in that town. That I should suit her in every respectbut the matrimonial, I did not doubt. I can pass muster in any companyas a teetotaller; I abominate tobacco (leastways it abominates me,which amounts to much about the same thing), and I am, or rather I canbe, tolerably amenable, if my surroundings are not positivelyinfernal, and there are no County Council children within shootingdistance.But for once my instincts were all wrong. The advertiser--a Miss Flora
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][EMOTION]Macdonald of [DIALOGUE]"Donald Murray House"--did _not_ resemble mypreconception of her in any respect. She was of medium height, anddainty build--a fairy-like creature clad in rustling silks, with wavy,white hair, bright, blue eyes, straight, delicate features, and hands,the shape and slenderness of which at once pronounced her a psychic.She greeted me with all the stately courtesy of the Old School; myportmanteau was taken upstairs by a solemn-eyed lad in the Macdonaldtartan; and the tea bell rang me down to a most appetising repast ofstrawberries and cream, scones, and delicious buttered toast. I fellin love with my hostess--it would be sheer sacrilege to designate sucha divine creature by the vulgar term of [DIALOGUE]"landlady"--at once. When
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][CONFLICT][CHARACTERIZATION][EMOTION]one's impressions of a place are at first exalted, they are often,later on, apt to become equally abased. In this case, however, it wasotherwise. My appreciation both of Miss Flora Macdonald and of herhouse daily increased. The food was all that could be desired, and mybedroom, sweet with the perfume of jasmine and roses, presented sucha picture of dainty cleanliness, as awakened in me feelings of shame,that it should be defiled by all my dusty, travel-worn accoutrements.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][RELIEF][CONTEXT][PERSPECTIVE]I flatter myself that Miss Macdonald liked me also. That she did notregard me altogether as one of the common herd was doubtless, in somedegree, due to the fact that she was a Jacobite; and in a discussionon the associations of her romantic namesake, [DIALOGUE]"Flora Macdonald," withPerthshire, it leaked out that our respective ancestors had commandedbattalions in Louis XIV.'s far-famed Scottish and Irish Brigades. Thatdiscovery bridged gulfs. We were no longer payer and paid--we were
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][DEATH]friends--friends for life.A lump comes into my throat as I pen these words, for it is only ashort time since I heard of her death.A week or so after I had settled in her home, I took, at hersuggestion, a rest (and, I quite agree with her, it was a verynecessary rest) from my writing, and spent the day on Loch Tay,leaving again for [DIALOGUE]"Donald Murray House" at seven o'clock in theevening. It was a brilliant, moonlight night. Not a cloud in the sky,
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][PLOT][EMOTION][FLASHBACK]and the landscape stood out almost as clearly as in the daytime. Icycled, and after a hard but thoroughly enjoyable spell of pedalling,eventually came to a standstill on the high road, a mile or two fromthe first lights of Pitlochry. I halted, not through fatigue, for Iwas almost as fresh as when I started, but because I was entrancedwith the delightful atmosphere, and wanted to draw in a few reallydeep draughts of it before turning into bed. My halting-place was on atriangular plot of grass at the junction of four roads. I propped my
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CONFLICT][HORROR]machine against a hedge, and stood with my back leaning against asign-post, and my face in the direction whence I had come. I remainedin this attitude for some minutes, probably ten, and was about toremount my bicycle, when I suddenly became icy cold, and a frightful,hideous terror seized and gripped me so hard, that the machine,slipping from my palsied hands, fell to the ground with a crash. Thenext instant something--for the life of me I knew not what, itsoutline was so blurred and indefinite--alighted on the open space infront of me with a soft thud, and remained standing as bolt uprightas a cylindrical pillar. From afar off, there then came the low rumbleof wheels, which momentarily grew in intensity, until there thunderedinto view a waggon, weighed down beneath a monstrous stack of hay, onthe top of which sat a man in a wide-brimmed straw hat, engaged in adeep confabulation with a boy in corduroys who sprawled beside him.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]The horse, catching sight of the motionless [DIALOGUE]"thing" opposite me, atonce stood still and snorted violently. The man cried out, [DIALOGUE]"Hey! hey!What's the matter with ye, beast?" And then in an hysterical kind ofscreech, [DIALOGUE]"Great God! What's yon figure that I see? What's yon figure,Tammas?"The boy immediately raised himself into a kneeling position, and,clutching hold of the man's arm, screamed, [DIALOGUE]"I dinna ken, I dinna ken,Matthew; but take heed, mon, it does na touch me. It's me it's comeafter, na ye."The moonlight was so strong that the faces of the speakers wererevealed to me with extraordinary vividness, and their horrifiedexpressions were even more startling than was the silent, ghastlyfigure of the Unknown. The scene comes back to me, here, in my littleroom in Norwood, with its every detail as clearly marked as on thenight it was first enacted. The long range of cone-shaped mountains,darkly silhouetted against the silvery sky, and seemingly hushed ingaping expectancy; the shining, scaly surface of some far-off tarn orriver, perceptible only at intervals, owing to the thick clusters ofgently nodding pines; the white-washed walls of cottages, glisteningamid the dark green denseness of the thickly leaved box trees, and thelight, feathery foliage of the golden laburnum; the undulatingmeadows, besprinkled with gorse and grotesquely moulded crags ofgranite; the white, the dazzling white roads, saturated withmoonbeams; all--all were overwhelmed with stillness--the stillnessthat belongs, and belongs only, to the mountains, and trees, andplains--the stillness of shadowland. I even counted the buttons, the
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]horn buttons, on the rustics' coats--one was missing from the man's,two from the boy's; and I even noted the sweat-stains under thearmpits of Matthew's shirt, and the dents and tears in Tammas's softwideawake. I observed all these trivialities and more besides. I sawthe abrupt rising and falling of the man's chest as his breath came insharp jerks; the stream of dirty saliva that oozed from between hisblackberry-stained lips and dribbled down his chin; I saw theirhands--the man's, square-fingered, black-nailed, big-veined, shiningwith perspiration and clutching grimly at the reins; the boy's,smaller, and if anything rather more grimy--the one pressed flat downon the hay, the other extended in front of him, the palm stretchedoutwards and all the fingers widely apart.And while these minute particulars were being driven into my soul, thecause of it all--the indefinable, esoteric column--stood silent andmotionless over-against the hedge, a baleful glow emanating from it.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION]The horse suddenly broke the spell. Dashing its head forward, it brokeoff at a gallop, and, tearing frantically past the phantasm, wenthelter-skelter down the road to my left. I then saw Tammas turning asomersault, miraculously saved from falling head first on to theroad, by rebounding from the pitchfork which had been wedged uprightin the hay, whilst the figure, which followed in their wake withprodigious bounds, was apparently trying to get at him with itsspidery arms. But whether it succeeded or not I cannot say, for I wasso uncontrollably fearful lest it should return to me, that I mountedmy bicycle and rode as I had never ridden before and have never riddensince.I described the incident to Miss Macdonald on my return. She looked
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][DANGER][PROBLEM][GHOST]very serious.[DIALOGUE]"It was stupid of me not to have warned you," she said. "That thatparticular spot in the road has always--at least ever since I canremember--borne the reputation of being haunted. None of the peasantsround here will venture within a mile of it after twilight, so thecarters you saw must have been strangers. No one has ever seen theghost except in the misty form in which it appeared to you. It does
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][FLASHBACK][DEATH][SURPRISE][DANGER][ACTION][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][MONSTER]not frequent the place every night; it only appears periodically; andits method never varies. It leaps over a wall or hedge, remainsstationary till some one approaches, and then pursues them withmonstrous springs. The person it touches invariably dies within ayear. I well recollect when I was in my teens, on just such a night asthis, driving home with my father from Lady Colin Ferner's croquetparty at Blair Atholl. When we got to the spot you name, the horse
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][DANGER][HORROR]shied, and before I could realise what had happened, we were racinghome at a terrific pace. My father and I sat in front, and the groom,a Highland boy from the valley of Ben-y-gloe, behind. Never havingseen my father frightened, his agitation now alarmed me horribly, andthe more so as my instinct told me it was caused by something otherthan the mere bolting of the horse. I was soon enlightened. A gigantic
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][DEATH][DANGER][CONFLICT][SURPRISE]figure, with leaps and bounds, suddenly overtook us, and, thrustingout its long, thin arms, touched my father lightly on the hand, andthen with a harsh cry, more like that of some strange animal than thatof a human being, disappeared. Neither of us spoke till we reachedhome,--I did not live here then, but in a house on the other side ofPitlochry,--when my father, who was still as white as a sheet, took measide and whispered, 'Whatever you do, Flora, don't breathe a word ofwhat has happened to your mother, and never let her go along that roadat night. It was the death bogle. I shall die within twelve months.'
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][GHOST]And he did.[DIALOGUE]"Miss Macdonald paused. A brief silence ensued, and she then went onwith all her customary briskness: "I cannot describe the thing anymore than you can, except that it gave me the impression it had noeyes. But what it was, whether the ghost of a man, woman, or somepeculiar beast, I could not, for the life of me, tell. Now, Mr.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][HAUNTED HOUSE]O'Donnell, have you had enough horrors for one evening, or would youlike to hear just one more?[DIALOGUE]"Knowing that sleep was utterly out of the question, and that one ortwo more thrills would make very little difference to my alreadyshattered nerves, I replied that I would listen eagerly to anythingshe could tell me, however horrible. My permission thus gained--andgained so readily--Miss Macdonald, not without, I noticed, one or twoapprehensive glances at the slightly rustling curtains, began hernarrative, which ran, as nearly as I can remember, as follows:--"After my father's death, I told my mother about our adventure thenight we drove home from Lady Colin Ferner's party, and asked her ifshe remembered ever having heard anything that could possibly accountfor the phenomenon. After a few moments' reflection, this is the storyshe told me:--THE INEXTINGUISHABLE CANDLE OF THE OLD WHITE HOUSEThere was once a house, known as [DIALOGUE]"The Old White House," that used tostand by the side of the road, close to where you say the horse firsttook fright. Some people of the name of Holkitt, relations of dear old
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][HAUNTED HOUSE]Sir Arthur Holkitt, and great friends of ours, used to live there. Thehouse, it was popularly believed, had been built on the site of anancient burial-ground. Every one used to say it was haunted, and theHolkitts had great trouble in getting servants. The appearance of thehaunted house did not belie its reputation, for its grey walls, sombregarden, gloomy hall, dark passages and staircase, and sinister-lookingattics could not have been more thoroughly suggestive of all kinds ofghostly phenomena. Moreover, the whole atmosphere of the place, no
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]matter how hot and bright the sun, was cold and dreary, and it was aconstant source of wonder to every one how Lady Holkitt could livethere. She was, however, always cheerful, and used to tell me thatnothing would induce her to leave a spot dear to so many generationsof her family, and associated with the happiest recollections in herlife. She was very fond of company, and there was scarcely a week inthe year in which she had not some one staying with her. I can onlyremember her as widow, her husband, a major in the Gordon Highlanders,having died in India before I was born. She had two daughters,
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][CONTEXT][CONFLICT][METAPHOR]Margaret and Alice, both considered very handsome, but some yearsolder than I. This difference in age, however, did not prevent ourbeing on very friendly terms, and I was constantly invited to theirhouse--in the summer to croquet and archery, in the winter to balls.Like most elderly ladies of that period, Lady Holkitt was very fond ofcards, and she and my mother used frequently to play bezique andcribbage, whilst the girls and I indulged in something rather morefrivolous. On those occasions the carriage always came for us at ten,since my mother, for some reason or other--I had a shrewd suspicion itwas on account of the alleged haunting--would never return home afterthat time. When she accepted an invitation to a ball, it was always
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]conditionally that Lady Holkitt would put us both up for the night,and the carriage used, then, to come for us the following day, afterone o'clock luncheon. I shall never forget the last time I went to adance at [DIALOGUE]"The Old White House," though it is now rather more thanfifty years ago. My mother had not been very well for some weeks,having, so she thought, taken cold internally. She had not had adoctor, partly because she did not feel ill enough, and partly becausethe only medical man near us was an apothecary, of whose skill she hada very poor opinion. My mother had quite made up her mind to accompany
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][TRANSITION]me to the ball, but at the last moment, the weather being appalling,she yielded to advice, and my aunt Norah, who happened to be stayingwith us at the time, chaperoned me instead. It was snowing when weset out, and as it snowed all through the night and most of the nextday, the roads were completely blocked, and we had to remain at [DIALOGUE]"TheOld White House" from Monday evening till the following Thursday. AuntNorah and I occupied separate bedrooms, and mine was at the end of along passage away from everybody else's. Prior to this my mother and Ihad always shared a room--the only really pleasant one, so I thought,in the house--overlooking the front lawn. But on this occasion there
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]being a number of visitors, belated like ourselves, we had to squeezein wherever we could; and as my aunt and I were to have separate rooms(my aunt liking a room to herself), it was natural that she should beallotted the largest and most comfortable. Consequently, she wasdomiciled in the wing where all the other visitors slept, whilst I wasforced to retreat to a passage on the other side of the house, where,with the exception of my apartment, there were none other butlumber-rooms. All went smoothly and happily, and nothing interruptedthe harmony of our visit, till the night before we returned home. Wehad had supper--our meals were differently arranged in those days--andMargaret and I were ascending the staircase on our way to bed, whenAlice, who had run upstairs ahead of us, met us with a scared face.[DIALOGUE]"Oh, do come to my room!" she cried. [DIALOGUE]"Something has happened to Mary."(Mary was one of the housemaids.)
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][HORROR]We both accompanied her, and, on entering her room, found Mary seatedon a chair, sobbing hysterically. One only had to glance at the girlto see that she was suffering from some very severe shock. Thoughnormally red-cheeked and placid, in short, a very healthy, stolidcreature, and the last person to be easily perturbed, she was nowwithout a vestige of colour, whilst the pupils of her eyes weredilated with terror, and her entire body, from the crown of her headto the soles of her feet, shook as if with ague. I was immeasurablyshocked to see her.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][SURPRISE][DANGER][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][HORROR][DIALOGUE]"Why, Mary," Margaret exclaimed, [DIALOGUE]"whatever is the matter? What hashappened?"[DIALOGUE]"It's the candle, miss," the girl gasped, [DIALOGUE]"the candle in Miss Trevor'sroom. I can't put it out."[DIALOGUE]"You can't put it out, why, what nonsense!" Margaret said. [DIALOGUE]"Are youmad?"[DIALOGUE]"It is as true as I sit here, miss," Mary panted. [DIALOGUE]"I put the candle onthe mantelpiece while I set the room to rights, and when I hadfinished and came to blow it out, I couldn't. I blew, and blew, andblew, but it hadn't any effect, and then I grew afraid, miss, horriblyafraid," and here she buried her face in her hands, and shuddered.[DIALOGUE]"I've never been frightened like this before, miss," she returnedslowly, [DIALOGUE]"and I've come away and left the candle burning."[DIALOGUE]"How absurd of you," Margaret scolded. "We must go and put it out atonce. I have a good mind to make you come with us, Mary--but there!
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][ACTION][CONFLICT][DANGER][EMOTION][PROBLEM][TRANSITION]Stay where you are, and for goodness' sake stop crying, or every onein the house will hear you.[DIALOGUE]"So saying, Margaret hurried off,--Alice and I accompanying her,--andon arriving outside my room, the door of which was wide open, weperceived the lighted candle standing in the position Mary haddescribed. I looked at the girls, and perceived, in spite of myendeavours not to perceive it, the unmistakable signs of a greatfear--fear of something they suspected but dared not name--lurking inthe corners of their eyes."Who will go first?[DIALOGUE]" Margaret demanded. No one spoke."Well then,[DIALOGUE]" she continued, "I will,[DIALOGUE]" and, suiting the action to theword, she stepped over the threshold. The moment she did so, the doorbegan to close. "This is curious![DIALOGUE]" she cried. "Push!"We did; we all three pushed; but, despite our efforts, the door cameresolutely to, and we were shut out. Then before we had time to
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][DANGER][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][FLASHBACK][HORROR]recover from our astonishment, it flew open; but before we could crossthe threshold, it came violently to in the same manner as before. Someunseen force held it against us.[DIALOGUE]"Let us make one more effort," Margaret said, [DIALOGUE]"and if we don'tsucceed, we will call for help."Obeying her instructions, we once again pushed. I was nearest thehandle, and in some manner,--how, none of us could ever explain,--justas the door opened of its own accord, I slipped and fell inside. Thedoor then closed immediately with a bang, and, to my unmitigatedhorror, I found myself alone in the room. For some seconds I was
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][DANGER][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][HORROR]spellbound, and could not even collect my thoughts sufficiently toframe a reply to the piteous entreaties of the Holkitts, who keptbanging on the door, and imploring me to tell them what was happening.Never in the hideous excitement of nightmare had I experienced such aterror as the terror that room conveyed to my mind. Though nothing wasto be seen, nothing but the candle, the light of which was peculiarlywhite and vibrating, I felt the presence of something inexpressiblymenacing and horrible. It was in the light, the atmosphere, thefurniture, everywhere. On all sides it surrounded me, on all sides I
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][DANGER][EMOTION][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][CHARACTERIZATION][PERSPECTIVE][DEATH][HORROR]was threatened--threatened in a manner that was strange and deadly.Something suggesting to me that the source of evil originated in thecandle, and that if I could succeed in extinguishing the light Ishould free myself from the ghostly presence, I advanced towards themantelpiece, and, drawing in a deep breath, blew--blew with theenergy born of desperation. It had no effect. I repeated my efforts; Iblew frantically, madly, but all to no purpose; the candle stillburned--burned softly and mockingly. Then a fearful terror seized me,
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][DANGER][EMOTION][SURPRISE]and, flying to the opposite side of the room, I buried my face againstthe wall, and waited for what the sickly beatings of my heart warnedme was coming. Constrained to look, I slightly, only very, veryslightly, moved round, and there, there, floating stealthily towardsme through the air, came the candle, the vibrating, glowing, balefulcandle. I hid my face again, and prayed God to let me faint. Nearerand nearer drew the light; wilder and wilder the wrenches at the door.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][EMOTION][DANGER][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][HORROR]Closer and closer I pressed myself to the wall. And then, then whenthe final throes of agony were more than human heart and brain couldstand, there came the suspicion, the suggestion of a touch--of a touchso horrid that my prayers were at last answered, and I fainted. When Irecovered, I was in Margaret's room, and half a dozen well-known formswere gathered round me. It appears that with the collapse of my bodyon the floor, the door, that had so effectually resisted every effortto turn the handle, immediately flew open, and I was discovered lyingon the ground with the candle--still alight--on the ground beside me.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][DEATH][SURPRISE][DANGER]My aunt experienced no difficulty in blowing out the refractorycandle, and I was carried with the greatest tenderness into the otherwing of the house, where I slept that night. Little was said about theincident next day, but all who knew of it expressed in their faces theutmost anxiety--an anxiety which, now that I had recovered, greatlypuzzled me. On our return home, another shock awaited me; we found toour dismay that my mother was seriously ill, and that the doctor, whohad been sent for from Perth the previous evening, just about the timeof my adventure with the candle, had stated that she might not survivethe day. His warning was fulfilled--she died at sunset. Her death, of
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][DEATH][CONTEXT][PERSPECTIVE]course, may have had nothing at all to do with the candle episode, yetit struck me then as an odd coincidence, and seems all the morestrange to me after hearing your account of the bogle that touchedyour dear father in the road, so near the spot where the Holkitts'house once stood. I could never discover whether Lady Holkitt or herdaughters ever saw anything of a superphysical nature in their house;after my experience they were always very reticent on that subject,and naturally I did not like to press it. On Lady Holkitt's death,Margaret and Alice sold the house, which was eventually pulled down,as no one would live in it, and I believe the ground on which it stoodis now a turnip field. That, my dear, is all I can tell you.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]       *       *       *       *       *[DIALOGUE]"Now, Mr. O'Donnell," Miss Macdonald added, [DIALOGUE]"having heard ourexperiences, my mother's and mine, what is your opinion? Do you thinkthe phenomenon of the candle was in any way connected with the bogleboth you and I have seen, or are the hauntings of 'The Old WhiteHouse' entirely separate from those of the road?"                         CASE II    THE TOP ATTIC IN PRINGLE'S MANSION, EDINBURGHA charming lady, Miss South, informs me that no house interested hermore, as a child, than Pringle's Mansion, Edinburgh. Pringle'sMansion, by the bye, is not the real name of the house, nor is theoriginal building still standing--the fact is, my friend has beenobliged to disguise the locality for fear of an action for slander oftitle, such as happened in the Egham Case of 1904-7.Miss South never saw--save in a picture--the house that so fascinatedher; but through repeatedly hearing about it from her old nurse, shefelt that she knew it by heart, and used to amuse herself hour afterhour in the nursery, drawing diagrams of the rooms and passages,which, to make quite realistic, she named and numbered.There was the Admiral's room, Madame's room, Miss Ophelia's room,Master Gregory's room, Letty's (the nurse's) room, the cook's room,the butler's room, the housemaid's room--and--the Haunted Room.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]The house was very old--probably the sixteenth century--and wasconcealed from the thoroughfare by a high wall that enclosed it on allsides. It had no garden, only a large yard, covered with faded yellowpaving-stones, and containing a well with an old-fashioned roller andbucket.When the well was cleaned out, an event which took place periodicallyon a certain date, every utensil in the house was called intorequisition for ladling out the water, and the Admiral, himselfsupervising, made every servant in the establishment take an activepart in the proceedings. On one of these occasions, the Admiralannounced his intention of going down the well in the bucket. That was
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][PERSPECTIVE][GHOST]a rare moment in Letty's life, for when the Admiral had been let downin the bucket, the rope broke!Indeed, the thought of what the Laird would say when he came up,almost resulted in his not coming up at all. However, some one,rather bolder than the rest, retained sufficient presence of mind toeffect a rescue, and the timid ones, thankful enough to survive theexplosion, had to be content on [DIALOGUE]"half-rations till further orders."But in spite of its association with such a martinet, and in spite ofher ghostly experiences in it, Letty loved the house, and was nevertired of singing its praises.It was a two-storeyed mansion, with roomy cellars but no basement.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][DANGER][PROBLEM][HAUNTED HOUSE]There were four reception-rooms--all oak-panelled--on the groundfloor; numerous kitchen offices, including a cosy housekeeper's room;and a capacious entrance hall, in the centre of which stood a broadoak staircase. The cellars, three in number, and chiefly used aslumber-rooms, were deep down and dank and horrid.On the first floor eight bedrooms opened on to a gallery overlookingthe hall, and the top storey, where the servants slept, consistedsolely of attics connected with one another by dark, narrow passages.It was one of these attics that was haunted, although, as a matter offact, the ghost had been seen in all parts of the house.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][HORROR]When Letty entered the Admiral's service she was but a bairn, and hadnever even heard of ghosts; nor did the other servants apprise her ofthe hauntings, having received strict injunctions not to do so fromthe Laird.But Letty's home, humble though it was, had been very bright andcheerful, and the dark precincts of the mansion filled her withdismay. Without exactly knowing why she was afraid, she shrank interror from descending into the cellars, and felt anything but pleasedat the prospect of sleeping alone in an attic. Still nothing occurredto really alarm her till about a month after her arrival. It was early
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][EMOTION][DANGER][HORROR]in the evening, soon after twilight, and she had gone down into one ofthe cellars to look for a boot-jack, which the Admiral swore by allthat was holy must be found before supper. Placing the light she hadbrought with her on a packing-case, she was groping about among theboxes, when she perceived, to her astonishment, that the flame of thecandle had suddenly turned blue. She then felt icy cold, and was muchstartled on hearing a loud clatter as of some metal instrument on thestone floor in the far-off corner of the cellar. Glancing in thedirection of the noise, she saw, looking at her, two eyes--twoobliquely set, lurid, light eyes, full of the utmost devilry. Sick
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][DANGER][HORROR]with terror and utterly unable to account for what she beheld, shestood stock-still, her limbs refusing to move, her throat parched, hertongue tied. The clanging was repeated, and a shadowy form beganslowly to crawl towards her. She dared not afterwards surmise whatwould have happened to her, had not the Laird himself come down atthis moment. At the sound of his stentorian voice the phantasmvanished. But the shock had been too much for Letty; she fainted, and
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][DANGER][CONFLICT][HAUNTED HOUSE]the Admiral, carrying her upstairs as carefully as if she had been hisown daughter, gave peremptory orders that she should never again beallowed to go into the cellar alone.But now that Letty herself had witnessed a manifestation, the otherservants no longer felt bound to secrecy, and soon poured into herears endless accounts of the hauntings.Every one, they informed her, except Master Gregory and Perkins (thebutler) had seen one or other of the ghosts, and the cellarapparition was quite familiar to them all. They also declared thatthere were other parts of the house quite as badly haunted as thecellar, and it might have been partly owing to these gruesome storiesthat poor Letty always felt scared, when crossing the passages leadingto the attics. As she was hastening down one of them, early one
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][DANGER][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][EMOTION][HORROR]morning, she heard some one running after her. Thinking it was one ofthe other servants, she turned round, pleased to think that some oneelse was up early too, and saw to her horror a dreadful-lookingobject, that seemed to be partly human and partly animal. The body wasquite small, and its face bloated, and covered with yellow spots. Ithad an enormous animal mouth, the lips of which, moving furiouslywithout emitting any sound, showed that the creature was endeavouringto speak but could not. The moment Letty screamed for help the
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][DANGER][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][HAUNTED HOUSE]phantasm vanished.But her worst experience was yet to come. The spare attic which shewas told was so badly haunted that no one would sleep in it, was theroom next to hers. It was a room Letty could well believe washaunted, for she had never seen another equally gloomy. The ceiling
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][DANGER][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK][TRANSITION][PROBLEM][HAUNTED HOUSE]was low and sloping, the window tiny, and the walls exhibited allsorts of odd nooks and crannies. A bed, antique and worm-eaten, stoodin one recess, a black oak chest in another, and at right angles withthe door, in another recess, stood a wardrobe that used to creak andgroan alarmingly every time Letty walked a long the passage. Once sheheard a chuckle, a low, diabolical chuckle, which she fancied camefrom the chest; and once, when the door of the room was open, shecaught the glitter of a pair of eyes--the same pale, malevolent eyesthat had so frightened her in the cellar. From her earliest childhoodLetty had been periodically given to somnambulism, and one night, justabout a year after she went into service, she got out of bed, andwalked, in her sleep, into the Haunted Room. She awoke to find herself
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][HORROR]standing, cold and shivering, in the middle of the floor, and it wassome seconds before she realised where she was. Her horror, when shedid discover where she was, is not easily described. The room wasbathed in moonlight, and the beams, falling with noticeablebrilliancy on each piece of furniture the room contained, at onceriveted Letty's attention, and so fascinated her that she foundherself utterly unable to move. A terrible and most unusual silencepredominated everywhere, and although Letty's senses were wonderfullyand painfully on the alert, she could not catch the slightest soundfrom any of the rooms on the landing.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]The night was absolutely still, no breath of wind, no rustle ofleaves, no flapping of ivy against the window; yet the door suddenlyswung back on its hinges and slammed furiously. Letty felt that thiswas the work of some supernatural agency, and, fully expecting thatthe noise had awakened the cook, who was a light sleeper (or pretendedshe was), listened in a fever of excitement to hear her get out of bedand call out. The slightest noise and the spell that held her prisonerwould, Letty felt sure, be broken. But the same unbroken silenceprevailed. A sudden rustling made Letty glance fearfully at the bed;
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]and she perceived, to her terror, the valance swaying violently, toand fro. Sick with fear, she was now constrained to stare in abjecthelplessness. Presently there was a slight, very slight movement onthe mattress, the white dust cover rose, and, under it, Letty saw theoutlines of what she took to be a human figure, gradually take shape.Hoping, praying, that she was mistaken, and that what appeared to beon the bed was but a trick of her imagination, she continued staringin an agony of anticipation. But the figure remained--extended at full
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][TRANSITION][METAPHOR][CONFLICT][DEATH]length like a corpse. The minutes slowly passed, a church clock boomedtwo, and the body moved. Letty's jaw fell, her eyes almost bulged fromher head, whilst her fingers closed convulsively on the folds of hernight-dress. The unmistakable sound of breathing now issued from theregion of the bed, and the dust-cover commenced slowly to slip aside.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][EMOTION][HORROR]Inch by inch it moved, until first of all Letty saw a few wisps ofdark hair, then a few more, then a thick cluster; then something whiteand shining--a protruding forehead; then dark, very dark brows; thentwo eyelids, yellow, swollen, and fortunately tightly closed; then--apurple conglomeration of Letty knew not what--of anything but whatwas human. The sight was so monstrous it appalled her; and she wasovercome with a species of awe and repulsion, for which the languageof mortality has no sufficiently energetic expression. She momentarilyforgot that what she looked on was merely superphysical, but regardedit as something alive, something that ought to have been a child,comely and healthy as herself--and she hated it. It was an outrage onmaternity, a blot on nature, a filthy discredit to the house, ablight, a sore, a gangrene. It turned over in its sleep, the cover was
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][EMOTION][CONFLICT][DANGER][HORROR]hurled aside, and a grotesque object, round, pulpy, webbed, and ofleprous whiteness--an object which Letty could hardly associate with ahand--came grovelling out. Letty's stomach heaved; the thing wasbeastly, indecent, vile, it ought not to live! And the idea of killingflashed through her mind. Boiling over with indignation and absurdlyforgetful of her surroundings, she turned round and groped for a stoneto smash it. The moonlight on her naked toes brought her to her
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][DANGER][SURPRISE][HORROR]senses--the thing in the bed was a devil! Though brought up a memberof the Free Church, with an abhorrence of anything that could in anyway be contorted into Papist practices, Letty crossed herself. As shedid so, a noise in the passage outside augmented her terror. Shestrained her ears painfully, and the sound developed into a footstep,soft, light, and surreptitious. It came gently towards the door; it
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SUSPENSE][EMOTION][SURPRISE]paused outside, and Letty intuitively felt that it was listening. Hersuspense was now so intolerable, that it was almost with a feeling ofrelief that she beheld the door slowly--very slowly--begin to open. Alittle wider--a little wider--and yet a little wider; but stillnothing came. Ah! Letty's heart turned to ice. Another inch, and a
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][DANGER][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][HORROR]shadowy something slipped through and began to wriggle itselfstealthily over the floor. Letty tried to divert her gaze, but couldnot--an irresistible, magnetic attraction kept her eyes glued to thegradually approaching horror. When within a few feet of her it halted;and again Letty felt it was listening--listening to the breathing onthe bed, which was heavy and bestial. Then it twisted round, and Lettywatched it crawl into the wardrobe. After this there was a long and
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]anxious wait. Then Letty saw the wardrobe door slyly open, and theeyes of the cellar--inexpressibly baleful, and glittering likeburnished steel in the strong phosphorescent glow of the moon, peepout,--not at her but _through_ her,--at the object lying on the bed.There were not only eyes, this time, but a form,--vague, misty, andirregular, but still with sufficient shape to enable Letty to identifyit as that of a woman, tall and thin, and with a total absence ofhair, which was emphasised in the most lurid and ghastly fashion. Witha snakelike movement, the evil thing slithered out of the wardrobe,and, gliding past Letty, approached the bed. Letty was obliged to
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]follow every proceeding. She saw the thing deftly snatch the bolsterfrom under the sleeping head; noted the gleam of hellish satisfactionin its eyes as it pressed the bolster down; and watched the murderedcreature's contortions grow fainter, and fainter, until they finallyceased. The eyes then left the room; and from afar off, away below, inthe abysmal cellars of the house, came the sound of digging--faint,very faint, but unquestionably digging. This terminated the grim,phantasmal drama for that night at least, and Letty, chilled to thebone, but thoroughly alert, escaped to her room. She spent her few
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][HAUNTED HOUSE]remaining hours of rest wide-awake, determining never to go to bedagain without fastening one of her arms to the iron staples.With regard the history of the house, Letty never learned anythingmore remarkable than that, long ago, an idiot child was supposed tohave been murdered in the haunted attic--by whom, tradition did notsay. The Admiral and his family left Pringle's Mansion the year Lettybecame Miss South's nurse, and as no one would stay in the house,presumably on account of the hauntings, it was pulled down, and aninexcusably inartistic edifice was erected in its place.                         CASE III    THE BOUNDING FIGURE OF [DIALOGUE]"---- HOUSE," NEAR      BUCKINGHAM TERRACE, EDINBURGHNo one is more interested in Psychical Investigation Work than MissTorfrida Vincent, one of the three beautiful daughters of Mrs. H. de
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE][HAUNTED HOUSE]B. Vincent, who is, herself, still in the heyday of life, and one ofthe loveliest of the society women I have met. Though I have known hersisters several years, I only met Torfrida for the first time a fewmonths ago, when she was superintending the nursing of her mother, whohad just undergone an operation for appendicitis. One day, when I wasvisiting my convalescent friend, Torfrida informed me that she knew ofa haunted house in Edinburgh, a case which she felt sure would arousemy interest and enthusiasm. [DIALOGUE]"It is unfortunate," she added somewhat
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][TRANSITION][SURPRISE]regretfully, [DIALOGUE]"that I cannot tell you the number of the house, but asI have given my word of honour to disclose it to no one, I feel sureyou will excuse me. Indeed, my friends the Gordons, who extracted thepromise from me, have got into sad trouble with their landlord forleaving the house under the pretext that it was haunted, and he hasthreatened to prosecute them for slander of title."The house in question has no claim to antiquity. It may be eighty yearsold--perhaps a little older--and was, at the time of which I speak, letout in flats. The Gordons occupied the second storey; the one abovethem was untenanted, and used as a storage place for furniture; thefirst floor and ground floor were divided into chambers and offices.They had not been in their new quarters more than a week, when Mrs.Gordon asked the night porter who it was that made such a noise, racingup their stairs between two and three in the morning. It had awakened
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]her every night, she told him, and she would be glad if the disturbancewere discontinued. [DIALOGUE]"I am sorry, Madam, but I cannot imagine who it canbe," the man replied. [DIALOGUE]"Of course, it may be some one next door, soundsare so often deceptive; no one inhabits the rooms above you." But Mrs.Gordon was not at all convinced, and made up her mind to complain tothe landlord should it occur again. That night nothing happened, butthe night after she was roused from her sleep at two o'clock, by afeeling that something dreadful, some dire catastrophe, was about totake place. The house was very still, and beyond the far-away echoes of
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]a policeman's patrol on the hard pavement outside, nothing, absolutelynothing, broke the universal, and as it seemed to her, unnaturalsilence. Generally at night-time there are sounds one likes to assureoneself are too trivial to be heard during the day--the creaking ofboards, stairs (nearly always stairs), and the tapping of some leaf (ofcourse some leaf) at the windows. Who has not heard such sounds, andwho in his heart of hearts has not been only too well aware that theyare nocturnal, exclusively nocturnal. The shadows of evening bring withthem visitors; prying, curious visitors; grim and ghastly visitors;grey, esoteric visitors; visitors from a world seemingly inconsequent,wholly incomprehensible. Mrs. Gordon did not believe in ghosts. She
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][WITCH]scoffed at the idea of ghosts, and, like so many would-be wits,unreasonably brave by day, and the reverse by night, had hithertoattributed banshees and the like to cats and other animals. Butnow,--now when all was dark,--pitch dark and hushed, and she, for aughtshe knew to the contrary, the only one, in that great ramblingbuilding, awake, she reviewed again and again, in her mind, thatrushing up the stairs. The wind! It could not have been the wind. The
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][SETTING]wind shuts doors, and rattles windows, and moans, and sighs, and howlsand screeches, but it does not walk the house in boots. Neither dorats! And if she had imagined the noises, why did she not imagine otherthings; why, for example, did she not see tables dance, and tea-urnswalk? All that would be fancy, unblushing, genuine fancy, and if sheconjured up one absurdity, why not another! That was a conundrum for
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][DANGER][PERSPECTIVE]any sceptic. Thus did she argue, naturally and logically, in the quitesensible fashion of a lawyer, or a scientist; yet, all the while, hersenses told her that the atmosphere of the house had undergone someprofoundly subtle and unaccountable change,--a change that brought withit a presence, at once sinister and hostile. She longed to strike alight and awake one of her daughters--Diana, by preference; since Dianawas the least likely to mind being disturbed, and had the strongestnerves. She made a start, and, loosening the bedclothes that she alwaysliked tightly tucked round her, thrust out a quivering toe. The next
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][MURDER]instant she drew it back with a tiny gasp of terror. The cold darknesswithout had suggested to her mind a great, horny hand, mal-shaped andmurderous, that was lying in wait to seize her. A deadly sicknessovercame her, and she lay back on the pillow, her heart beating withoutrageous irregularity and loudness. Very slowly she recovered, and,holding her breath, sidled to the far edge of the bed, and with adexterous movement, engendered by the desperation of fear, made alightning-like dab in the direction of the electric bell. Her soft,
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]pink finger missed the mark, and coming in violent contact with thewall, bent the carefully polished nail. She bit her lips to stop a cryof pain, and shrinking back within the folds of her dainty laceembroidered nightdress, abandoned herself to despair. Her consciousnessof the Unknown Presence increased, and she instinctively felt the thingpass through the closed door, down on to the landing outside, when itdashed upstairs with a loud clatter, and, entering the lumber-roomimmediately overhead, began bounding as if its feet were tied together,backwards and forwards across the floor. After continuing for fullyhalf an hour, the noises abruptly ceased and the house resumed itsaccustomed quiet. At breakfast, Mrs. Gordon asked her daughters if they
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE]had heard anything in the night, and they laughingly said [DIALOGUE]"No, not evena mouse!"There was now an intermission of the disturbances, and no furtherdemonstration occurred for about a month. Diana was then sleeping inher mother's room, Mrs. Gordon being away on a visit to Lady Voss, whowas entertaining a party of friends at her shooting-box in Argyle. Oneevening, as Diana was going into her bedroom to prepare for dinner,she saw the door suddenly swing open, and something, she could nottell what--it was so blurred and indistinct--come out with a bound.Tearing past her on to the landing, it rushed up the stairs with somuch clatter that Diana imagined, though she could see nothing, thatit must have on its feet, heavy lumbering boots. Filled with an
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE]irresistible curiosity, in spite of her alarm, Diana ran after it,and, on reaching the upper storey, heard it making a terrific racketin the room above the one in which she now slept. Nothing daunted,however, she boldly approached, and, flinging open the door, perceivedits filmy outline standing before a shadowy and very antique eight-dayclock, which apparently it was in the habit of winding. A great fearnow fell on Diana. What was the thing? And supposing it should turn
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][EMOTION]round and face her, what should she see? She was entirely isolatedfrom her sisters, and the servants--alone--the light fading--in a big,gloomy room full of strange old furniture which suggestedhiding-places for all sorts of grim possibilities. She was assured nowthat the thing she had followed was nothing human, neither was it adelusion, for when she shut her eyes and opened them, it was stillthere--and, oddly enough, it was now more distinct than it was whenshe had seen it downstairs. A curious feeling of helplessness stoleover Diana; the power of speech forsook her; and her limbs grew rigid.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SUSPENSE][CLIMAX][DANGER]She was so fearful, too, of attracting the notice of the mysteriousthing that she hardly dare breathe, and each pulsation of her heartsent cold chills of apprehension down her spine. Once she enduredagonies through a mad desire to sneeze, and once her lips opened toscream as something suspiciously like the antennæ of a huge beetle,and which she subsequently discovered was a [DIALOGUE]"devil's coach-horse,"tickled the calf of her leg. She fancied, too, that all sorts of queershapes lurked in the passage behind her, and that innumerable unseeneyes were malignantly rejoicing in her terror. At last, the climax toher suspense seemed at hand. The unknown thing, until now too busy
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][DEATH][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][EMOTION][ACTION][EXPOSITION][FLASHBACK][DANGER]with the clock to take heed of her, paused for a moment or so, as ifundecided what to do next, and then slowly began to veer round. Butthe faint echo of a voice below, calling her by name, broke thehypnotic spell that bound Diana to the floor, and with a franticspring she cleared the threshold of the room. She then tore madlydownstairs, never halting till she reached the dining-room, where shesank on a sofa, and, more dead than alive, panted out to her amazedsisters a full account of all that had transpired.That night she shared her sister's bedroom, but neither she nor hersister slept.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][HORROR]From this time till the return of Mrs. Gordon, nothing happened. Itwas one evening after she came back, when she was preparing to getinto bed, that the door of her own room unexpectedly opened, and shesaw standing, on the threshold, the unmistakable figure of a man,short and broad, with a great width of shoulders, and very long arms.He was clad in a peajacket, blue serge trousers, and jack-boots. Hehad a big, round, brutal head, covered with a tangled mass of yellowhair, but where his face ought to have been there was only a blotch,underlying which Mrs. Gordon detected the semblance to somethingfiendishly vindictive and immeasurably nasty. But, in spite of thehorror his appearance produced, her curiosity was aroused with regardto the two objects he carried in his hands, one of which looked likea very bizarre bundle of red and white rags, and the other a smallbladder of lard. Whilst she was staring at them in dumb awe, he swung
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CLIMAX][DANGER][CONFLICT][HAUNTED HOUSE]round, and, hitching them savagely under his armpits, rushed acrossthe landing, and, with a series of apish bounds, sprang up thestaircase and disappeared in the gloom.This was the climax; Mrs. Gordon felt another such encounter wouldkill her. So, in spite of the fact that she had taken the flat for ayear, and had only just commenced her tenancy, she packed up her goodsand left the very next day. The report that the building was hauntedspread rapidly, and Mrs. Gordon had many indignant letters from thelandlord. She naturally made inquiries as to the early history of the
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][PROBLEM][DANGER]house, but of the many tales she listened to, only one, theauthenticity of which she could not guarantee, seemed to suggest anyclue to the haunting.It was said that a retired Captain in the Merchant Service, many yearspreviously, had rented the rooms she had occupied.He was an extraordinary individual, and, despite the fact that he hadlived so far inland, would never wear any but nautical clothes--bluejersey and trousers, reefer coat and jack-boots. But this was not hisonly peculiarity. His love of grog eventually brought on delirium
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][DANGER][DEATH][PROBLEM][ACTION][CONFLICT][WEAPON][MURDER]tremens, and his excessive irritability in the interval between eachattack was a source of anxiety to all who came in contact with him. Atthat time there happened to be a baby in the rooms overhead, whosecrying so annoyed the Captain that he savagely informed its motherthat if she did not keep it quiet, he would not be answerable for theconsequences. His warnings having no effect, he flew upstairs one day,when she was temporarily absent, and, snatching up the bread knifefrom the table, decapitated the infant. He then stuffed both its headand body into a grandfather's clock which stood in one corner of theroom, and, retiring to his own quarters, drank till he was insensible.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][PROBLEM][DANGER][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][DEATH][METAPHOR][MURDER]He was, of course, arrested on a charge of murder, but being found[DIALOGUE]"insane" he was committed during His Majesty's pleasure to a lunaticasylum.He eventually committed suicide by opening an artery in his leg withone of his finger-nails.As the details of this tragedy filled in so well with the phenomenathey had witnessed, the Gordons could not help regarding the story asa very probable explanation of the hauntings. But, remember, itsauthenticity is dubious.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE]                         CASE IV    JANE OF GEORGE STREET, EDINBURGH[DIALOGUE]"The news that, for several years at any rate, George Street,Edinburgh, was haunted," wrote a correspondent of mine some short timeago, [DIALOGUE]"might cause no little surprise to many of its inhabitants." Andmy friend proceeded to relate his experience of the haunting, which Iwill reproduce as nearly as possible in his own words. I quote frommemory, having foolishly destroyed the letter.       *       *       *       *       *I was walking in a leisurely way along George Street the other day,towards Strunalls, where I get my cigars, and had arrived opposite No.--, when I suddenly noticed, just ahead of me, a tall lady ofremarkably graceful figure, clad in a costume which, even to anignoramus in fashions like myself, seemed extraordinarily out of date.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]In my untechnical language it consisted of a dark blue coat andskirt, trimmed with black braid. The coat had a very high collar,turned over to show a facing of blue velvet, its sleeves were veryfull at the shoulders, and a band of blue velvet drew it tightly in atthe waist. Moreover, unlike every other lady I saw, she wore a smallhat, which I subsequently learned was a toque, with one white and oneblue plume placed moderately high at the side. The only otherconspicuous items of her dress, the effect of which was, on the whole,quiet, were white glacé gloves,--over which dangled gold curbbracelets with innumerable pendants,--shoes, which were of patentleather with silver buckles and rather high Louis heels, and fine,blue silk openwork stockings. So much for her dress. Now for her
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]herself. She was a strikingly fair woman with very pale yellow hairand a startlingly white complexion; and this latter peculiarity soimpressed me that I hastened my steps, determining to get a full viewof her. Passing her with rapid strides, I looked back, and as I did soa cold chill ran through me,--what I looked at was--the face of thedead. I slowed down and allowed her to take the lead.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE]I now observed that, startling as she was, no one else seemed tonotice her. One or two people obviously, though probablyunconsciously, possessing the germs of psychism, shivered when theypassed her, but as they neither slackened their pace nor turned tosteal a second look, I concluded they had not seen her. Withoutglancing either to the right or left, she moved steadily on, pastMolton's the confectioner's, past Perrin's the hatter's. Once, Ithought she was coming to a halt, and that she intended crossing theroad, but no--on, on, on, till we came to D---- Street. There we were
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]preparing to cross over, when an elderly gentleman walked deliberatelyinto her. I half expected to hear him apologise, but naturally nothingof the sort happened; she was only too obviously a phantom, and, inaccordance with the nature of a phantom, she passed right through him.A few yards farther on, she came to an abrupt pause, and then, with aslight inclination of her head as if meaning me to follow, she glidedinto a chemist's shop. She was certainly not more than six feet aheadof me when she passed through the door, and I was even nearer thanthat to her when she suddenly disappeared as she stood before thecounter. I asked the chemist if he could tell me anything about the
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][FLASHBACK][GHOST]lady who had just entered his shop, but he merely turned away andlaughed.[DIALOGUE]"Lady!" he said; [DIALOGUE]"what are you talking about? You're a bit out of yourreckoning. This isn't the first of April. Come, what do you want?"I bought a bottle of formamints, and reluctantly and regretfullyturned away. That night I dreamed I again saw the ghost. I followedher up George Street just as I had done in reality; but when she cameto the chemist's shop, she turned swiftly round. [DIALOGUE]"I'm Jane!" she saidin a hollow voice. [DIALOGUE]"Jane! Only Jane!" and with that name ringing in my
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][CHARACTERIZATION][FLASHBACK][METAPHOR]ears I awoke.Some days elapsed before I was in George Street again. The weather hadin the meanwhile undergone one of those sudden and violent changes, socharacteristic of the Scottish climate. The lock-gates of heaven hadbeen opened and the rain was descending in cataracts. The few
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][DANGER]pedestrians I encountered were enveloped in mackintoshes, and carriedhuge umbrellas, through which the rain was soaking, and pouring offfrom every point. Everything was wet--everywhere was mud. The water,splashing upwards, saturated the tops of my boots and converted mytrousers into sodden sacks. Some weather isn't fit for dogs, but thisweather wasn't good enough for tadpoles--even fish would have kickedat it and kept in their holes. Imagine, then, the anomaly! Amidst all
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][FLASHBACK][METAPHOR][HORROR]this aqueous inferno, this slippery-sloppery, filth-bespatteringinferno, a spotlessly clean apparition in blue without eitherwaterproof or umbrella. I refer to Jane. She suddenly appeared, as Iwas passing The Ladies' Tea Association Rooms, walking in front of me.She looked just the same as when I last saw her--spick and span,and--dry. I repeat the word--dry--for that is what attracted myattention most. Despite the deluge, not a single raindrop touched
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][HORROR]her--the plumes on her toque were splendidly erect and curly, hershoe-buckles sparkled, her patent leathers were spotless, whilst thecloth of her coat and skirt looked as sheeny as if they had but justcome from Keeley's.Anxious to get another look at her face, I quickened my pace, and,darting past her, gazed straight into her countenance. The result wasa severe shock. The terror of what I saw--the ghastly horror of herdead white face--sent me reeling across the pavement. I let her pass
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][SURPRISE][HORROR]me, and, impelled by a sickly fascination, followed in her wake.Outside a jeweller's stood a hansom--quite a curiosity in these daysof motors--and, as Jane glided past, the horse shied. I have neverseen an animal so terrified. We went on, and at the next crossinghalted. A policeman had his hand up checking the traffic. His glance
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][RELIEF][SURPRISE][CLIMAX][CONFLICT]fell on Jane--the effect was electrical. His eyes bulged, his cheekswhitened, his chest heaved, his hand dropped, and he would undoubtedlyhave fallen had not a good Samaritan, in the guise of a non-psychicalpublic-house loafer, held him up. Jane was now close to the chemist's,and it was with a sigh of relief that I saw her glide in anddisappear.Had there been any doubt at all, after my first encounter with Jane,as to her being superphysical, there was certainly none now. The
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CONTEXT]policeman's paroxysm of fear and the horse's fit of shying were facts.What had produced them? I alone knew--and I knew for certain--it wasJane. Both man and animal saw what I saw. Hence the phantom was not
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][METAPHOR]subjective; it was not illusionary; it was a _bona fide_ spiritmanifestation--a visitant from the other world--the world ofearthbound souls. Jane fascinated me. I made endless researches inconnection with her, and, in answer to one of my inquiries, I wasinformed that eighteen years ago--that is to say, about the timeJane's dress was in fashion--the chemist's shop had been occupied by adressmaker of the name of Bosworth. I hunted up Miss Bosworth'saddress and called on her. She had retired from business and was
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]living in St. Michael's Road, Bournemouth. I came to the pointstraight.[DIALOGUE]"Can you give me any information," I asked, [DIALOGUE]"about a lady whoseChristian name was Jane?"[DIALOGUE]"That sounds vague!" Miss Bosworth said. [DIALOGUE]"I've met a good many Janesin my time."[DIALOGUE]"But not Janes with pale yellow hair, and white eyebrows andeyelashes!" And I described her in detail.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][DIALOGUE]"How do you come to know about her?" Miss Bosworth said, after a longpause.[DIALOGUE]"Because," I replied with a certain slowness and deliberationcharacteristic of me, [DIALOGUE]"because I've seen her ghost!"Of course I knew Miss Bosworth was no sceptic--the moment my eyesrested on her I saw she was psychic, and that the superphysical wasoften at her elbow. Accordingly, I was not in the least surprised ather look of horror.[DIALOGUE]"What!" she exclaimed, [DIALOGUE]"is she still there? I thought she would surelybe at rest now!"[DIALOGUE]"Who was she?" I inquired. "Come--you need not be afraid of me. I havecome here solely because the occult has always interested me. Who was
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][FLASHBACK][METAPHOR][HAUNTED HOUSE]Jane, and why should her ghost haunt George Street?[DIALOGUE]""It happened a good many years ago,[DIALOGUE]" Miss Bosworth replied, "in 1892.In answer to an advertisement I saw in one of the daily papers, Icalled on a Miss Jane Vernelt--Mademoiselle Vernelt she calledherself--who ran a costumier's business in George Street, in the verybuilding, in fact now occupied by the chemist you have mentioned. Thebusiness was for sale, and Miss Vernelt wanted a big sum for it.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][EMOTION][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][ACTION]However, as her books showed a very satisfactory annual increase inreceipts and her clientele included a duchess and other societyleaders, I considered the bargain a tolerably safe one, and we came toterms. Within a week I was running the business, and, exactly a monthafter I had taken it over, I was greatly astonished to receive a visitfrom Miss Vernelt. She came into the shop quite beside herself withagitation. 'It's all a mistake!' she screamed. 'I didn't want to sell
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][PROBLEM]it. I can't do anything with my capital. Let me buy it back.' Ilistened to her politely, and then informed her that as I had gone toall the trouble of taking over the business and had already succeededin extending it, I most certainly had no intention of selling it--atleast not for some time. Well, she behaved like a lunatic, and in the
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CONFLICT]end created such a disturbance that I had to summon my assistants andactually turn her out. After that I had no peace for six weeks. Shecame every day, at any and all times, and I was at last obliged totake legal proceedings. I then discovered that her mind was reallyunhinged, and that she had been suffering from softening of the brainfor many months. Her medical advisers had, it appeared, warned her to
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]give up business and place herself in the hands of trustworthy friendsor relations, who would see that her money was properly invested, butshe had delayed doing so; and when, at last, she did make up her mindto retire, the excitement, resulting from so great a change in hermode of living, accelerated the disease, and, exactly three weeksafter the sale of her business, she became a victim to the delusionthat she was ruined. This delusion grew more and more pronounced asher malady increased, and amidst her wildest ravings she clamoured tobe taken back to George Street. The hauntings, indeed, began beforeshe died; and I frequently saw her--when I knew her material body tobe under restraint--just as you describe, gliding in and out theshow-rooms.[DIALOGUE]"For several weeks after her death, the manifestations continued--theythen ceased, and I have never heard of her again until now."If I remember rightly the account of the George Street ghost hereterminated; but my friend referred to it again at the close of hisletter.[DIALOGUE]"Since my return to Scotland," he wrote, [DIALOGUE]"I have frequently visitedGeorge Street, almost daily, but I have not seen 'Jane.' I only hopethat her poor distracted spirit has at last found rest." And with thiskindly sentiment my correspondent concluded.                          CASE V    THE SALLOW-FACED WOMAN OF NO. -- FORREST
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]      ROAD, EDINBURGHThe Public unfortunately includes a certain set of people, of themiddle class very [DIALOGUE]"middlish," who are ever on the look-out for someopportunity, however slight and seemingly remote, of betteringthemselves socially; and, learning that those in a higher strata ofsociety are interested in the supernatural, they think that they maypossibly get in touch with them by working up a little localreputation for psychical research. I have often had letters from thistype of [DIALOGUE]"pusher" (letters from genuine believers in the Occult Ialways welcome) stating that they have been greatly interested in mybooks--would I be so very kind as to grant them a brief interview, orpermit them to accompany me to a haunted house, or give them certaininformation with regard to Lady So-and-so, whom they have long wantedto know? Occasionally, I have been so taken in as to give permissionto the writer to call on me, and almost always I have bitterlyrepented. The wily one--no matter how wily--cannot conceal the clovenhoof for long, and he has either tried to thrust himself into thebosom of my family, or has written to my neighbours declaring himselfto be my dearest friend; and when, in desperation, I have shown himthe cold shoulder, he has attacked me virulently in some [DIALOGUE]"rag" of alocal paper, the proprietor, editor, or office-boy of which happens tobe one of his own clique. I have even known an instance where this
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]type of person has, through trickery, actually gained access to somenotoriously haunted house, and from its owners--the family he has longhad his eyes on, from a motive anything but psychic--has ferreted outthe secret and private history of the haunting. Then, when he has been[DIALOGUE]"found out" and forced to see that his friendship is not wanted, hehas, in revenge for the slight, unblushingly revealed the facts thatwere only entrusted to him in the strictest confidence; and, throughinfluence with the lower stratum of the Press, caused a most glaringand sensational account of the ghost to be published.With such a case in view, I cannot be surprised that possessors offamily ghosts and haunted houses should show the greatest reluctanceto be approached on the subject, save by those they feel assured willtreat it with the utmost delicacy.But I have quoted the above breach of confidence merely to giveanother reason for my constant use of fictitious names with regard topeople and places, and having done so (I hope to some purpose), I willproceed with the following story:--Miss Dulcie Vincent, some of whose reminiscences appeared in my bookof _Ghostly Phenomena_ last year, is nearly connected with Lady AdelaMinkon, who owns a considerable amount of house property, includingNo. -- Forrest Road, in Edinburgh, and whose yacht at Cowes is the
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][FLASHBACK][TRANSITION][EMOTION][DANGER][HAUNTED HOUSE]envy of all who have cruised in her. Three years ago, Lady Adelastayed at No. -- Forrest Road. She had heard that the house washaunted, and was anxious to put it to the test. Lady Adela was
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][RESOLUTION][PERSPECTIVE][HAUNTED HOUSE]perfectly open-minded. She had never experienced any occult phenomenaherself, but, very rationally, she did not consider that hernon-acquaintance with the superphysical in any way negatived theevidence of those who declare that they have witnessed manifestations;their statements, she reasoned, were just as worthy of credence ashers. She thus commenced her occupation of the house with a perfectlyunbiased mind, resolved to stay there for at least a year, so as togive it a fair trial. The hauntings, she was told, were at theirheight in the late summer and early autumn. It is, I think,
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]unnecessary to enter into any detailed description of her house. Inappearance, it differed very little, if at all, from those adjoiningit; in construction, it was if anything a trifle larger. The basement,which included the usual kitchen offices and cellars, was very dark,and the atmosphere--after sunset on Fridays, only on Fridays--wastainted with a smell of damp earth, shockingly damp earth, and of asweet and nauseating something that greatly puzzled Lady Adela. Allthe rooms in the house were of fair dimensions, and cheerful,excepting on this particular evening of the week; a distinct gloomsettled on them then, and the strangest of shadows were seen playingabout the passages and on the landings.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][DIALOGUE]"It may be fancy," Lady Adela said to herself, [DIALOGUE]"merely fancy! And,after all, if I encounter nothing worse than a weekly menu of aromaticsmells and easily digested shadows, I shall not suffer any harm"; butit was early summer then--the psychic season had yet to come. As theweeks went by, the shadows and the smell grew more and morepronounced, and by the arrival of August had become so emphatic thatLady Adela could not help thinking that they were both hostile andaggressive.About eight o'clock on the evening of the second Friday in the month,Lady Adela was purposely alone in the basement of the house. The
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][EMOTION][PERSPECTIVE]servants especially irritated her; like the majority of present-daydomestics, products of the County Council schools, they were sointensely supercilious and silly, and Lady Adela felt that theirpresence in the house minimised her chances of seeing the ghost. Noapparition with the smallest amount of self-respect could risk comingin contact with such inane creatures, so she sent them all out for amotor drive, and, for once, rejoiced in the house to herself. Acurious proceeding for a lady! True! but then, Lady Adela was a lady,
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]and, being a lady, was not afraid of being thought anything else; andso acted just as unconventionally as she chose. But stay a moment; shewas not alone in the house, for she had three of her dogs withher--three beautiful boarhounds, trophies of her last trip to theBaltic. With such colossal and perfectly trained companions Lady Adelafelt absolutely safe, and ready--as she acknowledged afterwards--toface a whole army of spooks. She did not even shiver when the frontdoor of the basement closed, and she heard the sonorous birring of themotor, drowning the giddy voices of the servants, grow fainter andfainter until it finally ceased altogether.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][PERSPECTIVE]When the last echoes of the vehicle had died away in the distance,Lady Adela made a tour of the premises. The housekeeper's room pleasedher immensely--at least she persuaded herself it did. [DIALOGUE]"Why, it isquite as nice as any of the rooms upstairs," she said aloud, as shestood with her face to the failing sunbeams and rested her strongwhite hand on the edge of the table. "Quite as nice. Karl and Max,
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]come here![DIALOGUE]"But the boarhounds for once in their lives did not obey her with agood grace. There was something in the room they did not like, andthey showed how strong was their resentment by slinking unwillinglythrough the doorway."I wonder why that is?[DIALOGUE]" Lady Adela mused; "I have never known them doit before." Then her eyes wandered round the walls, and struggled invain to reach the remoter angles of the room, which had suddenly growndark. She tried to assure herself that this was but the natural effectof the departing daylight, and that, had she watched in other housesat this particular time, she would have noticed the same thing. Toshow how little she minded the gloom, she went up to the darkestcorner and prodded the walls with her riding-whip. She laughed--there
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]was nothing there, nothing whatsoever to be afraid of, only shadows.With a careless shrug of her shoulders, she strutted into thepassage, and, whistling to Karl and Max who, contrary to their custom,would not keep to heel, made another inspection of the kitchens. Atthe top of the cellar steps she halted. The darkness had now set ineverywhere, and she argued that it would be foolish to venture intosuch dungeon-like places without a light. She soon found one, and,
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CONFLICT][SURPRISE]armed with candle and matches, began her descent. There were severalcellars, and they presented such a dismal, dark appearance, that sheinstinctively drew her skirts tightly round her, and exchanged theslender riding-whip for a poker. She whistled again to her dogs. Theydid not answer, so she called them both by name angrily. But for some
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]reason (some quite unaccountable reason, she told herself) they wouldnot come.She ransacked her mind to recall some popular operatic air, andalthough she knew scores she could not remember one. Indeed, the onlyair that filtered back to her was one she detested--a Vaudeville tuneshe had heard three nights in succession, when she was staying with astudent friend in the Latin Quarter in Paris. She hummed it loudly,however, and, holding the lighted candle high above her head, walkeddown the steps. At the bottom she stood still and listened. From high
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]above her came noises which sounded like the rumbling of distantthunder, but which, on analysis, proved to be the rattling ofwindow-frames. Reassured that she had no cause for alarm, Lady Adelaadvanced. Something black scudded across the red-tiled floor, and shemade a dash at it with her poker. The concussion awoke countlessechoes in the cellars, and called into existence legions of otherblack things that darted hither and thither in all directions. She
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][EMOTION][DANGER][CONFLICT][HORROR]burst out laughing--they were only beetles! Facing her she nowperceived an inner cellar, which was far gloomier than the one inwhich she stood. The ceiling was very low, and appeared to be crusheddown beneath the burden of a stupendous weight; and as she advancedbeneath it she half expected that it would [DIALOGUE]"cave in" and bury her.A few feet from the centre of this cellar she stopped; and, bendingdown, examined the floor carefully. The tiles were unmistakably newer
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE]here than elsewhere, and presented the appearance of having been putin at no very distant date. The dampness of the atmosphere wasintense; a fact which struck Lady Adela as somewhat odd, since thefloor and walls looked singularly dry. To find out if this were thecase, she ran her fingers over the walls, and, on removing them, foundthey showed no signs of moisture. Then she rapped the floor and walls,and could discover no indications of hollowness. She sniffed the air,and a great wave of something sweet and sickly half choked her. She
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION]drew out her handkerchief and beat the air vigorously with it; but thesmell remained, and she could not in any way account for it. Sheturned to leave the cellar, and the flame of her candle burned blue.Then for the first time that evening--almost, indeed, for the firsttime in her life--she felt afraid, so afraid that she made no attemptto diagnose her fear; she understood the dogs' feelings now, andcaught herself wondering how much they knew.She whistled to them again, not because she thought they wouldrespond,--she knew only too well they would not,--but because shewanted company, even the company of her own voice; and she had somefaint hope, too, that whatever might be with her in the cellar, wouldnot so readily disclose itself if she made a noise. The one cellar was
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][DANGER][EMOTION][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][HORROR]passed, and she was nearly across the floor of the other when sheheard a crash. The candle dropped from her hand, and all the blood inher body rushed to her heart. She could never have imagined it was soterrible to be frightened. She tried to pull herself together and becalm, but she was no longer mistress of her limbs. Her knees knocked
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]together and her hands shook. [DIALOGUE]"It was only the dogs," she feebly toldherself, [DIALOGUE]"I will call them"; but when she opened her mouth, she foundher throat was paralysed--not a syllable would come. She knew, too,that she had lied, and that the hounds could not have been responsiblefor the noise. It was like nothing she had ever heard, nothing shecould imagine; and although she struggled hard against the idea, shecould not help associating the sound with the cause of the candleburning blue, and the sweet, sickly smell. Incapable of moving a
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][EMOTION][DANGER][HORROR]step, she was forced to listen in breathless expectancy for arecurrence of the crash. Her thoughts become ghastly. The inky sea ofdarkness that hemmed her in on every side suggested every sort ofghoulish possibility, and with each pulsation of her overstrainedheart her flesh crawled. Another sound--this time not a crash, nothinghalf so loud or definite--drew her eyes in the direction of the steps.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][CONFLICT]An object was now standing at the top of them, and something lurid,like the faint, phosphorescent glow of decay, emanated from all overit; but _what_ it was, she could not for the life of her tell. Itmight have been the figure of a man, or a woman, or a beast, or ofanything that was inexpressibly antagonistic and nasty. She would havegiven her soul to have looked elsewhere, but her eyes were fixed--shecould neither turn nor shut them. For some seconds the shape remainedmotionless, and then with a sly, subtle motion it lowered its head,and came stealing stealthily down the stairs towards her. She followed
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][HORROR]its approach like one in a hideous dream--her heart ready to burst,her brain on the verge of madness. Another step, another, yetanother; till there were only three left between her and it; and shewas at length enabled to form some idea of what the thing was like.It was short and squat, and appeared to be partly clad in a loose,flowing garment, that was not long enough to conceal the glisteningextremities of its limbs. From its general contour and the tangledmass of hair that fell about its neck and shoulders, Lady Adelaconcluded it was the phantasm of a woman. Its head being kept bent,
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]she was unable to see the face in full, but every instant she expectedthe revelation would take place, and with each separate movement ofthe phantasm her suspense became more and more intolerable. At last itstood on the floor of the cellar, a broad, ungainly, horribly ungainlyfigure, that glided up to and past her into the far cellar. There ithalted, as nearly as she could judge on the new tiles, and remainedstanding. As she gazed at it, too fascinated to remove her eyes, therewas a loud, reverberating crash, a hideous sound of wrenching andtearing, and the whole of the ceiling of the inner chamber came downwith an appalling roar. Lady Adela thinks that she must then have
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]fainted, for she distinctly remembers falling--falling into whatseemed to her a black, interminable abyss. When she recoveredconsciousness, she was lying on the tiles, and all around was stilland normal. She got up, found and lighted her candle, and spent therest of the evening, without further adventure, in the drawing-room.All the week Lady Adela struggled hard to master a disinclination tospend another evening alone in the house, and when Friday came shesuccumbed to her fears. The servants were poor, foolish things, but it
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][PERSPECTIVE][TRANSITION][RELIEF][METAPHOR][FLASHBACK]was nice to feel that there was something in the house besides ghosts.She sat reading in the drawing-room till late that night, and when shelolled out of the window to take a farewell look at the sky and starsbefore retiring to rest, the sounds of traffic had completely ceasedand the whole city lay bathed in a refreshing silence. It was veryheavenly to stand there and feel the cool, soft air--unaccompanied,for the first time during the day, by the rattling rumbling sounds oflocomotion and the jarring discordant murmurs of unmusicalvoices--fanning her neck and face.Lady Adela, used as she was to the privacy of her yacht, and thefreedom of her big country mansion, where all sounds were regulated ather will, chafed at the near proximity of her present habitation tothe noisy thoroughfare, and vaguely looked forward to the hours whenshops and theatres were closed, and all screeching, harsh-voicedproducts of the gutter were in bed. To her the nights in Waterloo
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CONFLICT]Place were all too short; the days too long, too long for anything.The heavy, lumbering steps of a policeman at last broke her reverie.She had no desire to arouse his curiosity; besides, her costume hadbecome somewhat disordered, and she had the strictest sense ofpropriety, at least in the presence of the lower orders. Retiring,therefore, with a sigh of vexation, she sought her bedroom, and, afterthe most scrupulous attention to her toilet, put out the lights andgot into bed. It was just one when she fell asleep, and three when she
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][HORROR]awoke with a violent start. Why she started puzzled her. She did notrecollect experiencing any very dreadful dream, in fact no dream atall, and there seemed nothing in the hush--the apparently unbrokenhush--that could in any way account for her action. Why, then, had shestarted? She lay still and wondered. Surely everything was just as it
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][CHARACTER][CHARACTERIZATION][TRANSITION][DANGER][PROBLEM][GHOST]was when she went to sleep! And yet! When she ventured on a diagnosis,there was something different, something new; she did not think it wasactually in the atmosphere, nor in the silence; she did not know whereit was until she opened her eyes--and then she _knew_. Bending overher, within a few inches of her face, was another face, the ghastlycaricature of a human face. It was on a larger scale than that of any
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]mortal Lady Adela had ever seen; it was long in proportion to itswidth--indeed, she could not make out where the cranium terminated atthe back, as the hinder portion of it was lost in a mist. Theforehead, which was very receding, was partly covered with a mass oflank, black hair, that fell straight down into space; there were noneck nor shoulders, at least none had materialised; the skin wasleaden-hued, and the emaciation so extreme that the raw cheek-boneshad burst through in places; the size of the eye sockets whichappeared monstrous, was emphasised by the fact that the eyes wereconsiderably sunken; the lips were curled downwards and tightly shut,and the whole expression of the withered mouth, as indeed that of theentire face, was one of bestial, diabolical malignity. Lady Adela'sheart momentarily stopped, her blood ran cold, she was petrified; andas she stared helplessly at the dark eyes pressed close to hers, shesaw them suddenly suffuse with fiendish glee. The most frightfulchange then took place: the upper lip writhed away from a few greenishyellow stumps; the lower jaw fell with a metallic click, leaving themouth widely open, and disclosing to Lady Adela's shocked vision ablack and bloated tongue; the eyeballs rolled up and entirelydisappeared, whilst their places were immediately filled with thefoulest and most loathsome indications of advanced decay. A strong,
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]vibratory movement suddenly made all the bones in the head rattle andthe tongue wag, whilst from the jaws, as if belched up from somedeep-down well, came a gust of wind, putrescent with the ravages ofthe tomb, and yet, at the same time, tainted with the same sweet,sickly odour with which Lady Adela had latterly become so familiar.This was the culminating act; the head then receded, and, growingfainter and fainter, gradually disappeared altogether. Lady Adela wasnow more than satisfied,--there was not a house more horribly hauntedin Scotland,--and nothing on earth would induce her to remain in itanother night.However, being anxious, naturally, to discover something that might,in some degree, account for the apparitions, Lady Adela made endlessinquiries concerning the history of former occupants of the house;but, failing to find out anything remarkable in this direction, shewas eventually obliged to content herself with the followingtradition: It was said that on the site of No. -- Forrest Road there
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CONFLICT][DANGER][METAPHOR][FLASHBACK][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][GHOST]had once stood a cottage occupied by two sisters (both nurses), andthat one was suspected of poisoning the other; and that the cottage,moreover, having through their parsimonious habits got into a very badstate of repair, was blown down during a violent storm, the survivingsister perishing in the ruins. Granted that this story is correct, itwas in all probability the ghost of this latter sister that appearedto Lady Adela. Her ladyship is, of course, anxious to let No.-- Forrest Road, and as only about one in a thousand people seem topossess the faculty of seeing psychic phenomena, she hopes she may oneday succeed in getting a permanent tenant. In the meanwhile, she is
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]doing her level best to suppress the rumour that the house ishaunted.                         CASE VI    THE PHANTOM REGIMENT OF KILLIECRANKIEMany are the stories that have from time to time been circulated withregard to the haunting of the Pass of Killiecrankie by phantomsoldiers, but I do not think there is any stranger story than thatrelated to me, some years ago, by a lady who declared she had actuallywitnessed the phenomena. Her account of it I shall reproduce as far aspossible in her own words:--       *       *       *       *       *Let me commence by stating that I am not a spiritualist, and that Ihave the greatest possible aversion to convoking the earthbound soulsof the dead. Neither do I lay any claim to mediumistic powers (indeedI have always regarded the term [DIALOGUE]"medium" with the gravest suspicion).
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE][CONTEXT][CLIMAX][PERSPECTIVE][TRANSITION][CHARACTERIZATION][EXPOSITION][CHARACTER]I am, on the contrary, a plain, practical, matter-of-fact woman, andwith the exception of this one occasion, never witnessed any psychicphenomena.The incident I am about to relate took place the autumn before last. Iwas on a cycle tour in Scotland, and, making Pitlochry my temporaryheadquarters, rode over one evening to view the historic Pass ofKilliecrankie. It was late when I arrived there, and the western skywas one great splash of crimson and gold--such vivid colouring I hadnever seen before and never have seen since. Indeed, I was so
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][EMOTION]entranced at the sublimity of the spectacle, that I perched myself ona rock at the foot of one of the great cliffs that form the walls ofthe Pass, and, throwing my head back, imagined myself in fairyland.Lost, thus, in a delicious luxury, I paid no heed to the time, nor didI think of stirring, until the dark shadows of the night fell acrossmy face. I then started up in a panic, and was about to pedal off inhot haste, when a strange notion suddenly seized me: I had a latchkey,plenty of sandwiches, a warm cape, why should I not camp out theretill early morning--I had long yearned to spend a night in the open,now was my opportunity. The idea was no sooner conceived than putinto operation. Selecting the most comfortable-looking boulder I could
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][HORROR]see, I scrambled on to the top of it, and, with my cloak drawn tightlyover my back and shoulders, commenced my vigil. The cold mountain air,sweet with the perfume of gorse and heather, intoxicated me, and Igradually sank into a heavenly torpor, from which I was abruptlyaroused by a dull boom, that I at once associated with distantmusketry. All was then still, still as the grave, and, on glancing atthe watch I wore strapped on my wrist, I saw it was two o'clock. Aspecies of nervous dread now laid hold of me, and a thousand and onevague fancies, all the more distressing because of their vagueness,oppressed and disconcerted me. Moreover, I was impressed for the first
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE]time with the extraordinary solitude--solitude that seemed to belongto a period far other than the present, and, as I glanced around atthe solitary pines and gleaming boulders, I more than half expected tosee the wild, ferocious face of some robber chief--some fierce yetfascinating hero of Sir Walter Scott's--peering at me from behindthem. This feeling at length became so acute, that, in a panic offear--ridiculous, puerile fear, I forcibly withdrew my gaze andconcentrated it abstractedly on the ground at my feet. I thenlistened, and in the rustling of a leaf, the humming of some nightinsect, the whizzing of a bat, the whispering of the wind as it moanedsoftly past me, I fancied--nay, I felt sure I detected something thatwas not ordinary. I blew my nose, and had barely ceased marvelling atthe loudness of its reverberations, before the piercing, ghoulishshriek of an owl sent the blood in torrents to my heart. I then
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CONFLICT]laughed, and my blood froze as I heard a chorus, of what I tried topersuade myself could only be echoes, proceed from every crag and rockin the valley. For some seconds after this I sat still, hardly daringto breathe, and pretending to be extremely angry with myself for beingsuch a fool. With a stupendous effort I turned my attention to themost material of things. One of the skirt buttons on my hip--they weremuch in vogue then--being loose, I endeavoured to occupy myself intightening it, and when I could no longer derive any employment fromthat, I set to work on my shoes, and tied knots in the laces, merelyto enjoy the task of untying them. But this, too, ceasing at last to
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]attract me, I was desperately racking my mind for some other device,when there came again the queer, booming noise I had heard before, butwhich I could now no longer doubt was the report of firearms. I lookedin the direction of the sound--and--my heart almost stopped. Racingtowards me--as if not merely for his life, but his soul--came thefigure of a Highlander. The wind rustling through his long dishevelledhair, blew it completely over his forehead, narrowly missing his eyes,which were fixed ahead of him in a ghastly, agonised stare. He had nota vestige of colour, and, in the powerful glow of the moonbeams, hisskin shone livid. He ran with huge bounds, and, what added to my
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][HORROR]terror and made me double aware he was nothing mortal, was that eachtime his feet struck the hard, smooth road, upon which I could wellsee there was no sign of a stone, there came the sound, theunmistakable sound of the scattering of gravel. On, on he came, withcyclonic swiftness; his bare sweating elbows pressed into his pantingsides; his great, dirty, coarse, hairy fists screwed up in bonybunches in front of him; the foam-flakes thick on his clenched,grinning lips; the blood-drops oozing down his sweating thighs. It wasall real, infernally, hideously real, even to the most minute details:the flying up and down of his kilt, sporan, and swordless scabbard;the bursting of the seam of his coat, near the shoulder; and theabsence of one of his clumsy shoe-buckles. I tried hard to shut myeyes, but was compelled to keep them open, and follow his everymovement as, darting past me, he left the roadway, and, leapingseveral of the smaller obstacles that barred his way, finallydisappeared behind some of the bigger boulders. I then heard the loud
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][EMOTION][TRANSITION]rat-tat of drums, accompanied by the shrill voices of fifes andflutes, and at the farther end of the Pass, their arms glitteringbrightly in the silvery moonbeams, appeared a regiment of scarlet-cladsoldiers. At the head rode a mounted officer, after him came theband, and then, four abreast, a long line of warriors; in their centretwo ensigns, and on their flanks, officers and non-commissionedofficers with swords and pikes; more mounted men bringing up the rear.On they came, the fifes and flutes ringing out with a weird clearnessin the hushed mountain air. I could hear the ground vibrate, thegravel crunch and scatter, as they steadily and mechanicallyadvanced--tall men, enormously tall men, with set, white faces andlivid eyes. Every instant I expected they would see me, and I became
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]sick with terror at the thought of meeting all those pale, flashingeyes. But from this I was happily saved; no one appeared to notice me,and they all passed me by without as much as a twist or turn of thehead, their feet keeping time to one everlasting and monotonous tramp,tramp, tramp. I got up and watched until the last of them had turnedthe bend of the Pass, and the sheen of his weapons and trappings couldno longer be seen; then I remounted my boulder and wondered ifanything further would happen. It was now half-past two, and blendedwith the moonbeams was a peculiar whiteness, which rendered the wholeaspect of my surroundings indescribably dreary and ghostly. Feeling
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]cold and hungry, I set to work on my beef sandwiches, and wasreligiously separating the fat from the lean, for I am one of thosefoolish people who detest fat, when a loud rustling made me look up.Confronting me, on the opposite side of the road, was a tree, an ash,and to my surprise, despite the fact that the breeze had fallen andthere was scarcely a breath of wind, the tree swayed violently to andfro, whilst there proceeded from it the most dreadful moanings andgroanings. I was so terrified that I caught hold of my bicycle andtried to mount, but I was obliged to desist as I had not a particle ofstrength in my limbs. Then to assure myself the moving of the tree wasnot an illusion, I rubbed my eyes, pinched myself, called aloud; butit made no difference--the rustling, bending, and tossing stillcontinued. Summing up courage, I stepped into the road to get a closer
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][SURPRISE][DANGER][CONFLICT][HORROR]view, when to my horror my feet kicked against something, and, onlooking down, I perceived the body of an English soldier, with aghastly wound in his chest. I gazed around, and there, on all sides ofme, from one end of the valley to the other, lay dozens ofbodies,--bodies of men and horses,--Highlanders and English,white-cheeked, lurid eyes, and bloody-browed,--a hotch-potch of livid,gory awfulness. Here was the writhing, wriggling figure of an officerwith half his face shot away; and there, a horse with no head; andthere--but I cannot dwell on such horrors, the very memory of whichmakes me feel sick and faint. The air, that beautiful, fresh mountainair, resounded with their moanings and groanings, and reeked with thesmell of their blood. As I stood rooted to the ground with horror, not
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][GHOST]knowing which way to look or turn, I suddenly saw drop from the ash,the form of a woman, a Highland girl, with bold, handsome features,raven black hair, and the whitest of arms and feet. In one hand shecarried a wicker basket, in the other a knife, a broad-bladed,sharp-edged, horn-handled knife. A gleam of avarice and cruelty cameinto her large dark eyes, as, wandering around her, they rested on therich facings of the English officers' uniforms. I knew what was inher mind, and--forgetting she was but a ghost--that they were allghosts--I moved heaven and earth to stop her. I could not. Making
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][ACTION]straight for a wounded officer that lay moaning piteously on theground, some ten feet away from me, she spurned with her slender,graceful feet, the bodies of the dead and dying English that came inher way. Then, snatching the officer's sword and pistol from him, sheknelt down, and, with a look of devilish glee in her glorious eyes,calmly plunged her knife into his heart, working the blade backwardsand forwards to assure herself she had made a thorough job of it.Anything more hellish I could not have imagined, and yet it fascinatedme--the girl was so fair, so wickedly fair and shapely. Her act ofcruelty over, she spoiled her victim of his rings, epaulets, buttonsand gold lacing, and, having placed them in her basket, proceededelsewhere. In some cases, unable to remove the rings easily, she
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CONFLICT][MURDER]chopped off the fingers, and popped them, just as they were, into herbasket. Neither was her mode of dispatch always the same, for whileshe put some men out of their misery in the manner I have described,she cut the throats of others with as great a nonchalance as if shehad been killing fowls, whilst others again she settled with thebutt-ends of their guns or pistols. In all she murdered a fullhalf-score, and was decamping with her booty when her gloating eyessuddenly encountered mine, and with a shrill scream of rage she rushedtowards me. I was an easy victim, for strain and pray how I would, Icould not move an inch. Raising her flashing blade high over her head,
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CLIMAX]an expression of fiendish glee in her staring eyes, she made ready tostrike me. This was the climax, my overstrained nerves could stand nomore, and ere the blow had time to descend, I pitched heavily forwardand fell at her feet. When I recovered, every phantom had vanished,and the Pass glowed with all the cheerful freshness of the earlymorning sun. Not a whit the worse for my venture, I cycled swiftlyhome, and ate as only one can eat who has spent the night amid thebanks and braes of bonnie Scotland.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CONFLICT][HAUNTED HOUSE]                         CASE VII    [DIALOGUE]"PEARLIN' JEAN" OF ALLANBANKFew ghosts have obtained more notoriety than [DIALOGUE]"Pearlin' Jean," thephantasm which for many years haunted Allanbank, a seat of theStuarts.The popular theory as to the identity of the apparition is asfollows:--Mr. Stuart, afterwards created first baronet of Allanbank, when on atour in France, met a young and beautiful French Sister of Charity ofthe name of Jean, whom he induced to leave her convent. Tiring of herat length, Mr. Stuart brutally left her, and, returning abruptly toScotland, became engaged to be married to a lady of his ownnationality and position in life. But Jean was determined he shouldnot escape her so easily. For him she had sacrificed everything: her
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][ACTION][CONFLICT][RESOLUTION][SURPRISE][TRANSITION]old vocation in life was gone, she had no home, no honour,--nothing,so she resolved to leave no stone unturned to discover hiswhereabouts. At last her perseverance was rewarded, and, Fortunefavouring her, she arrived without mishap at Allanbank.The truth was then revealed to her: her cruel and faithless lover wasabout to be wedded to another. But despair gave her energy, and,burning with indignation, she hastened to his house to upbraid him.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][EMOTION][PROBLEM][DANGER][PERSPECTIVE][CONFLICT][HORROR]She reached the spot just as he was driving out with his fiancée. Witha cry of anguish, Jean rushed forward and, swinging herself nimbly onto the fore-wheel of the coach, turned her white and passionate facetowards its occupants. For a moment, Mr. Stuart was too dumbfounded todo anything; he could scarcely believe his senses. Who on earth wasthis frantic female? Good Heavens! Jean! Impossible! How on earth had
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][DANGER][PROBLEM]she got there? And the tumultuous beating of his guilty heart turnedhim sick and faint.Then he glanced fearfully and covertly at his fiancée. _She_ must notknow the truth at any cost. Possibly he lost his head! At all events,
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]that is the kindest construction to put on his subsequent action,for, dastardly as his behaviour had been to Jean in the past, one canhardly imagine him capable of deliberately murdering her, and in sohorrible a fashion. There was not a second to lose; an instant more,and the secret, that he had so assiduously hidden from the lady besidehim, would be revealed. Jean's mouth was already open to speak. Hewaved her aside. She adhered to her post. He shouted to the postilion,
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]and the huge, lumbering vehicle was set in motion. At the first turnof the wheels, Jean slipped from her perch, her dress caught in thespokes, and she was crushed to death.Her fate does not appear to have made any deep impression either onMr. Stuart or his lady-love, for they continued their drive.The hauntings began that autumn. Mr. Stuart, as was only fit and
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][HORROR]proper, being the first to witness the phenomenon. Returning home froma drive one evening, he perceived to his surprise the dark outlines ofa human figure perched on the arched gateway of his house, exactlyopposite the spot where Jean had perished. Wondering who it could be,he leaned forward to inspect it closer. The figure moved, an icycurrent of air ran through him, and he saw to his horror the lividcountenance of the dead Jean. There she was, staring down at him with
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][DANGER][CONFLICT][EMOTION][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][HAUNTED HOUSE]lurid, glassy eyes; her cheeks startlingly white, her hair flutteringin the wind, her neck and forehead bathed in blood.Paralysed with terror, Mr. Stuart could not remove his gaze, and itwas not until one of the menials opened the carriage door to assisthim down, that the spell was broken and he was able to speak and move.He then flew into the house, and spent the rest of the night in themost abject fear.After this he had no peace--Allanbank was constantly haunted. The
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][TRANSITION][CHARACTER][HAUNTED HOUSE]great oak doors opened and shut of their own accord at night with loudclanging and bangs, and the rustling of silks and pattering ofhigh-heeled shoes were heard in the oak-panelled bedrooms and alongthe many dark and winding passages.From her attire, which was a piece of lace made of thread, theapparition became known as [DIALOGUE]"Pearlin' Jean," and a portrait of her wasactually painted. It is recorded that when this picture was hungbetween one of Mr. Stuart and his lady-love, the hauntings ceased, butthat as soon as it was removed they were renewed. Presumably, it wasnot allowed to remain in the aforesaid position long, for themanifestations appear to have gone on for many years withoutintermission.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][METAPHOR][PERSPECTIVE][COMEDIC HORROR]Most phantasms of the dead inspire those who see them withhorror,--and that is my own experience,--but [DIALOGUE]"Pearlin' Jean" seems tohave been an exception to this rule. A housekeeper called BettyNorrie, who lived for many years at Allanbank, declared that otherpeople besides herself had so frequently seen Jean that they had grownquite accustomed to her, and were, consequently, no more alarmed ather appearance than they were by her noises.Another servant at the house, of the name of Jenny Blackadder, usedconstantly to hear Jean, but could never see her--though her husbanddid.The latter, when courting Jenny, received a rare scare, which suggeststo me that Jean, in spite of her tragic ending, may not have beenwithout a spice of humour. Thomas, for that was the swain's name,
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][SURPRISE]made an assignation one night to meet Jenny in the orchard atAllanbank.It was early when he arrived at the trysting-place--for Thomas, likeall true lovers, was ever rather more than punctual--and he fullycontemplated a long wait. Judge, then, of his astonishment, when heperceived in the moonlight what he took to be the well-known andadored figure of his lady-love. With a cry of delight, Thomas rushedforward, and, swinging his arms widely open to embrace her, beheld hervanish, and found himself hugging space! An icy current of air
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][DANGER][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][EMOTION][HORROR]thrilled through him, and the whole place--trees, nooks, moonbeams,and shadows, underwent a hideous metamorphosis. The very air bristledwith unknown horrors till flesh and blood could stand no more, and,even at the risk of displeasing his beloved Jenny, Thomas fled! Somefew minutes later, at the appointed hour, Jenny arrived on the scene,and no one was there. She dallied for some time, wondering whatevercould have happened to Thomas, and then returned, full of graveapprehensions, to the house.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][METAPHOR][FLASHBACK][CONFLICT][EMOTION][SURPRISE][GHOST]It was not until the next morning that the truth leaked out, andJenny, after indulging in a hearty laugh at her lover, who felt veryshamefaced now that it was daylight, sensibly forgave him, and raisedno obstacle when asked to fix a day for their marriage.In after years, Jenny used to retail the story with many harrowingallusions to [DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE]"Pearlin' Jean," whom she somewhat foolishly made use ofas a bogey to frighten children into being good. A Mr. Sharpe, whowhen he was a little boy was once placed in her charge, confesses thathe was dreadfully scared at her stories, and that he never ventureddown a passage in those days without thinking "Pearlin' Jean," withher ghostly, blood-stained face, clawlike hands, and rustling lacedress, was after him.Nurse Jenny used to tell him that the Stuarts tried in vain to layJean's spirit, actually going to the length of calling in sevenministers to exorcise it. But all to no purpose; it still continued
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][DANGER][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][TRANSITION][HAUNTED HOUSE]its nocturnal peregrinations.In the year 1790 the Stuarts let the house to strangers, who, whenthey took it, had not the least idea that it was haunted. However,they did not long remain in ignorance, for two ladies, who occupiedthe same bedroom, were awakened in the night by hearing some onewalking across the floor. The [DIALOGUE]"presence" did not suggest burglars, forthe intruder behaved in the most noisy manner, pacing restlessly andapparently aimlessly backwards and forwards across the room, swishingthe floor (with what sounded like a long lace train) and breathingheavily. They were both terrified, and so cold that they could hear
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][GHOST]one another's teeth chatter. They were too frightened to call forhelp; they could only lie still, hoping and praying it would not comenearer to them. The sufferings of these two ladies were indescribable,for the ghost remained in their room all night, moving restlesslyabout until daybreak. It was not until some days later, when otherpeople in the house had experienced the phenomenon, that they weretold the story of the notorious [DIALOGUE]"Pearlin' Jean."But was the so-called [DIALOGUE]"Pearlin' Jean" really the apparition of themurdered French woman? To my mind, her identity with that of the
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][DANGER][PERSPECTIVE][METAPHOR][GHOST]beautiful Sister of Charity has not been satisfactorily established,and I think there are reasons to doubt it.If, for instance, the apparition were that of a Sister of Charity, whyshould it appear incongruously attired in a long trailing gown oflace? And if it were that of a woman of the presumably staid habits ofa Sister of Charity, why should it delight in mischief and play thepranks of a _poltergeist_? And yet if it wasn't the ghost of Jean,whose ghost was it?
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][DEATH][DANGER][METAPHOR][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE][HAUNTED HOUSE]                        CASE VIII    THE DRUMMER OF CORTACHYWhat ancient Scottish or Irish family has not its Family Ghost? Abanshee--the heritage of Niall of the Nine Hostages--is still theunenviable possession of his descendants, the O'Donnells, and I, whoam a member of the clan, have both seen and heard it several times. Asit appears to me, it resembles the decapitated head of a prehistoricwoman, and I shall never forget my feelings one night, when, arousedfrom slumber by its ghastly wailing, I stumbled frantically out ofbed, and, groping my way upstairs in the dark, without venturing tolook to the left or right lest I should see something horrible, foundevery inmate of the house huddled together on the landing, paralysedwith fear. I did not see it on that occasion, but on the followingmorning, as I had anticipated, I received the news that a near anddear relative had died.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CONTEXT][CHARACTER][PERSPECTIVE][HAUNTED HOUSE]Possessing such an heirloom myself, I can therefore readily sympathisewith those who own a similar treasure--such, for example, as thefamous, or rather infamous, Drummer of Cortachy Castle, who isinvariably heard beating a tattoo before the death of a member of theclan of Ogilvie.Mrs. Crowe, in her _Night Side of Nature_, referring to the haunting,says:--"Miss D., a relative of the present Lady C., who had been staying sometime with the Earl and Countess at their seat, near Dundee, wasinvited to spend a few days at Cortachy Castle, with the Earl andCountess of Airlie. She went, and whilst she was dressing for dinner
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][FLASHBACK][TRANSITION]the first evening of her arrival, she heard a strain of music underher window, which finally resolved itself into a well-defined sound ofa drum. When her maid came upstairs, she made some inquiries about thedrummer that was playing near the house; but the maid knew nothing onthe subject. For the moment the circumstance passed from Miss D.'smind, but, recurring to her again during the dinner, she said,addressing Lord Airlie, 'My lord, who is your drummer?' Upon which his
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][DEATH]lordship turned pale, Lady Airlie looked distressed, and several ofthe company, who all heard the question, embarrassed; whilst the lady,perceiving that she had made some unpleasant allusion, although sheknew not to what their feelings referred, forebore further inquirytill she reached the drawing-room; when, having mentioned thecircumstance again to a member of the family, she was answered, 'What,have you never heard of the drummer boy?' 'No,' replied Miss D.; 'whoin the world is he?' 'Why,' replied the other, 'he is a person whogoes about the house playing his drum, whenever there is a deathimpending in the family. The last time he was heard was shortly before
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][DEATH][SURPRISE][DANGER][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][EMOTION][MURDER]the death of the last Countess (the Earl's former wife); and that iswhy Lord Airlie became so pale when you mentioned it. The drummer boyis a very unpleasant subject in this family, I assure you.'"Miss D. was naturally much concerned, and indeed not a littlefrightened at this explanation, and her alarm being augmented byhearing the sounds on the following day, she took her departure fromCortachy Castle, and returned to Lord C.'s, where she related this
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][DANGER][CONTEXT][METAPHOR][DEATH]strange circumstance to the family, through whom the informationreached me.[DIALOGUE]"This affair was very generally known in the north, and we awaited theevent with interest. The melancholy death of the Countess about fiveor six months afterwards, at Brighton, sadly verified theprognostications. I have heard that a paper was found in her deskafter her death, declaring her conviction that the drum was for her."Mrs. Crowe goes on to explain the origin of the phenomenon. Accordingto legend, she says, there was once at Cortachy a drummer, who,incurring the jealousy of the then Lord Airlie, was thrust into hisown drum and flung from a window of the tower (in which, by the way,Miss D. slept). Before being put to death thus, the drummer is statedto have said he would for ever after haunt the Airlie family--a threathe has obviously been permitted to fulfil.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][FLASHBACK]During one of my visits to Scotland, I stayed some days in Forfarshirenot far from Cortachy. Among the visitors at my hotel was a very oldgentleman of the name of Porter, who informed me that, when a boy, heused to visit some relatives who, at that time, lived within easywalking distance of Cortachy. One of these relatives was a lad ofabout fourteen, named Alec, with whom he had always been the closestof friends. The recollection of their many adventures evidentlyafforded Mr. Porter infinite amusement, and one of these adventures,in particular, he told me, was as fresh in his mind as if it hadhappened yesterday.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][DIALOGUE]"Looking back upon it now," he said, with a far-away look in his eyes,[DIALOGUE]"it certainly was a strange coincidence, and if you are interested inthe hauntings of Cortachy, Mr. O'Donnell, you may, perhaps, like tohear the account of my ghostly experiences in that neighbourhood."Of course I replied that nothing would give me greater pleasure, andMr. Porter forthwith began his story.[DIALOGUE]"One misty night in October, my friend Alec and I, both being keen onrabbiting, determined to visit a spinney adjoining the Cortachyestate, in pursuit of our quarry. Alec had chosen this particularnight, thinking, under cover of the mist, to escape the vigilance ofthe keepers, who had more than once threatened to take him before thelaird for trespassing."To gain access to the spinney we had to climb a granite wall and dropon the other side--the drop, in addition to being steep, beingrendered all the more precarious by reason of the man-traps thekeepers were in the habit of setting. When I got astride the wall andpeered into the well-like darkness at our feet, and heard the grimrustling of the wind through the giant pines ahead of me, I would havegiven all I possessed to have found myself snug and warm in bed; butAlec was of a different 'kidney'--he had come prepared for excitement,and he meant to have it. For some seconds, we both waited on the wallin breathless silence, and then Alec, with a reckless disregard ofwhat might be in store for him, gently let himself drop, and I,fearing more, if anything, than the present danger, to be for everafter branded as a coward if I held back, timidly followed suit. By agreat stroke of luck we alighted in safety on a soft carpeting ofmoss. Not a word was spoken, but, falling on hands and knees, and
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][EMOTION]guiding ourselves by means of a dark lantern Alec had boughtsecond-hand from the village blacksmith, we crept on all-fours along atiny bramble-covered path, that after innumerable windings eventuallybrought us into a broad glade shut in on all sides by lofty trees.Alec prospected the spot first of all to see no keepers were about,and we then crawled into it, and, approaching the nearest burrows, setto work at once with our ferrets. Three rabbits were captured in thisfashion, and we were eagerly anticipating the taking of more, when asensation of icy coldness suddenly stole over us, and, on lookinground, we perceived, to our utmost consternation, a very tall keeperstanding only a few yards away from us. For once in a way, Alec wasnonplussed, and a deathly silence ensued. It was too dark for us to
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][DANGER][EMOTION][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][ACTION][HORROR]see the figure of the keeper very distinctly, and we could onlydistinguish a gleaming white face set on a very slight andperpendicular frame, and a round, glittering something that puzzled usboth exceedingly. Then, a feeling that, perhaps, it was not a keepergradually stole over me, and in a paroxysm of ungovernable terror Icaught hold of Alec, who was trembling from head to foot as if he hadthe ague. The figure remained absolutely still for about a minute,during which time neither Alec nor I could move a muscle, and then,turning round with an abrupt movement, came towards us."Half-dead with fright, but only too thankful to find that we had nowregained the use of our limbs, we left our spoil and ran for our livesin the direction of the wall.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][DIALOGUE]"We dared not look back, but we knew the figure followed us, for weheard its footsteps close at our heels; and never to my dying dayshall I forget the sound--rat-tat, tat, rat-tat, tat--for all theworld like the beat of a muffled drum."How we ever managed to reach the wall I could never tell, but as wescrambled over it, regardless of man-traps and bruises, and plungedinto the heather on the other side, we heard the weird footstepsreceding in the direction of the castle, and, ere we had reached home,the rat-tat, tat, rat-tat, tat, had completely died away.[DIALOGUE]"We told no one a word of what had happened, and a few days after,simultaneously with the death of one of the Airlies, we learned, forthe first time, the story of the Phantom Drummer."I have little doubt,[DIALOGUE]" Mr. Porter added, in conclusion, "that thefigure we took to be a keeper was the prophetic Drummer, for I canassure you there was no possibility of hoaxers, especially in suchill-omened guise, anywhere near the Cortachy estate."Poor old Mr. Porter! He did not long survive our _rencontre_. When Inext visited the hotel, some months later, I was genuinely grieved tohear of his decease. His story had greatly fascinated me, for I lovethe solitude of the pines, and have myself from time to time witnessedmany remarkable occult phenomena under the shadow of their loftysummits. One night, during this second visit of mine to the hotel, the
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][EMOTION][FLASHBACK][RELIEF]mood to ramble came upon me, and, unable to resist the seductivethought of a midnight stroll across the bracken-covered hills, Iborrowed a latchkey, and, armed with a flask of whisky and a thickstick, plunged into the moonlit night. The keen, heather-scented airacted like a tonic--I felt younger and stronger than I had felt foryears, and I congratulated myself that my friends would hardly know meif they saw me now, as I swung along with the resuscitated stride oftwenty years ago. The landscape for miles around stood out withstartling clearness in the moonshine, and I stopped every now and thento drink in the beauties of the glittering mountain-ranges and silent,glimmering tarns. Not a soul was about, and I found myself, as I lovedto be, the only human element in the midst of nature. Every now and
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]then a dark patch fluttered across the shining road, and with a weirdand plaintive cry, a night bird dashed abruptly from hedge to hedge,and seemingly melted into nothingness. I quitted the main road on thebrow of a low hill, and embarked upon a wild expanse of moor, lavishlycovered with bracken and white heather, intermingled with which werethe silvery surfaces of many a pool of water. For some seconds I stoodstill, lost in contemplating the scenery,--its utter abandonment andgrand sense of isolation; and inhaling at the same time long and deepdraughts of the delicious moorland air, unmistakably impregnated nowwith breaths of ozone. My eyes wandering to the horizon, I detected,on the very margin of the moorland, a dense clump of trees, which Iinstantly associated with the spinney in my old friend Mr. Porter'sstory, and, determining that the renowned spinney should be my goal, Iat once aimed for it, vigorously striking out along the path which Ithought would be most likely to lead to it. Half an hour's brisk
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE]walking brought me to my destination, and I found myself standingopposite a granite wall which my imagination had no difficulty inidentifying with the wall so well described by Mr. Porter. Removingthe briars and gorse prickles which left little of my stockings whole,I went up to the wall, and, measuring it with my body, found it was agood foot taller than I. This would mean rather more climbing than Ihad bargained for. But the pines--the grim silence of their slenderframes and gently swaying summits--fascinated me. They spoke of
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]possibilities few could see or appreciate as I could; possibilities ofa sylvan phantasmagoria enhanced by the soft and mystic radiance ofthe moon. An owl hooted, and the rustling of brushwood told me of thenear proximity of some fur-coated burrower in the ground. High abovethis animal life, remoter even than the tops of my beloved trees orthe mountain-ranges, etched on the dark firmament, shone multitudinousstars, even the rings round Saturn being plainly discernible. From theMilky Way my eyes at length wandered to the pines, and a puff of airladen with the odour of their resin and decaying brushwood decided me.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][DANGER]I took a few preliminary sips of whisky, stretched my rusty limbs,and, placing one foot in a jagged crevice of the wall, swarmedpainfully up. How slow and how hazardous was the process! I scratchedmy fingers, inured to the pen but a stranger to any rougher substance;I ruined my box-calf boots, I split my trousers at the knees, and Ifelt that my hat had parted with its shape for ever; and yet Icontinued the ascent. The end came all too suddenly. When within an
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION]ace of victory, I yielded to impulse, and with an energy the desperatecondition of my skin and clothes alone could account for, I swung up,and--the outer edge of the wall melted beneath me, my handsfrantically clutched at nothingness, a hideous sensation of fallingsurged through my brain, my ears and eyes filled to bursting, and witha terrific crash that seemed to drive my head and spine right throughmy stomach, I met the black, uprising earth, and lost consciousness.Providentially for me, I had pitched head first into a furze bushwhich broke the fall, otherwise I must have met with serious injury.As it was, when I recovered my momentary loss of consciousness, Ifound that I had sustained no worse harm than a severe shaking,scratches galore, and the utter demolition of my clothes! I pickedmyself up with difficulty, and spent some time searching for my hatand stick--which I at length discovered, lodged, of course, where onewould least have thought of looking for them. I then took close stock
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE]of my surroundings, and found them even grimmer than I hadanticipated. Though the trees were packed closely together, and therewas much undergrowth, the moonbeams were so powerful and so fullyconcentrated on the spinney, that I could see no inconsiderabledistance ahead of me. Over everything hung a solemn and preternaturalhush. I saw shadows everywhere--shadows that defied analysis and hadno material counterparts. A sudden crashing of brushwood brought me to
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][SURPRISE][METAPHOR]a standstill, and sent the blood in columns to my heart. Then Ilaughed loudly--it was only a hare, the prettiest and pertest thingimaginable. I went on. Something whizzed past my face. I drew back in
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][DANGER][WEAPON][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][HORROR]horror--it was a bat, merely a bat. My nerves were out of order, thefall had unsteadied them; I must pull myself together. I did so, andcontinued to advance. A shadow, long, narrow, and grotesque, fellacross my path, and sent a thousand and one icy shivers down my back.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][HORROR]In an agony of terror I shut my eyes and plunged madly on. Somethingstruck me in the face and hurled me back. My eyes openedinvoluntarily, and I saw a tree that, either out of pique or sheerobstinacy, had planted itself half-way across the path. I examined itsbranches to make sure they _were_ branches, and continued my march. A
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][HORROR]score more paces, a sudden bend, and I was in an open space,brilliantly illuminated by moonbeams and peopled with countless,moving shadows. One would have to go far to find a wilder, weirder,and more grimly suggestive spot. As I stood gazing at the scene inawestruck wonder, a slight breeze rocked the tops of the pine trees,and moaning through their long and gloomy aisles reverberated likethunder. The sounds, suggesting slightly, ever so slightly, a tattoo,brought with them vivid pictures of the Drummer, too vivid just thento be pleasant, and I turned to go. To my unmitigated horror, a white
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][CHARACTER][DANGER][EMOTION][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][HORROR]and lurid object barred my way. My heart ceased to beat, my bloodturned to ice; I was sick, absolutely sick, with terror. Besides this,the figure held me spellbound--I could neither move nor utter a sound.It had a white, absolutely white face, a tall, thin, perpendicularframe, and a small, glittering, rotund head. For some seconds it
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]remained stationary, and then, with a gliding motion, left the pathand vanished in the shadows.Again a breeze rustled through the tops of the pine trees, moanedthrough their long and gloomy aisles, and reverberated like thunder;rat-tat, tat, rat-tat, tat--and with this sound beating in my ears,reaction set in, and I never ceased running till I had reached myhotel.                         CASE IX    THE ROOM BEYOND. AN ACCOUNT OF THE HAUNTINGS      AT HENNERSLEY, NEAR AYRTo me Hennersley is what the Transformation Scene at a Pantomime wasto the imaginative child--the dreamy child of long ago--a floralparadise full of the most delightful surprises. Here, at Hennersley,
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION]from out the quite recently ice-bound earth, softened and moistenednow by spring rain, there rises up row upon row of snowdrops,hyacinths and lilies, of such surpassing sweetness and beauty that Ihold my breath in astonishment, and ecstatically chant a Te Deum tothe fairies for sending such white-clad loveliness.And then--then, ere my wonder has had time to fade, it is summer. Theground opens, and there springs up, on all sides, a veritable sea ofvivid, variegated colour,--scarlet, pink, and white geraniums; red,white and yellow roses; golden honeysuckle; bright-hued marigolds;purple pansies; pale forget-me-nots; wallflowers; sweet peas;many-tinted azaleas; showy hydrangeas; giant rhododendrons; foxgloves,buttercups, daisies, hollyhocks, and heliotropes; a floral host toovaried to enumerate.Overcome with admiration, bewildered with happiness, I kneel on thesoft carpet of grass, and, burying my face extravagantly, in alternatelaps of luxurious, downy, scent-laden petals, fill my lungs withsoul-inspiring nectar.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CLIMAX][TRANSITION][EMOTION][RELIEF][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE]My intoxication has barely worn off before my eyes are dimly consciousthat the soil all around me is generously besprinkled with the remainsof my floral friends. I spring hurriedly to my feet, and, gazinganxiously about me, suddenly perceive the gaily nodding heads of newarrivals--dahlias, sunflowers, anemones, chrysanthemums. As I continuegazing, the aromatic odour of mellow apples from the Hennersleyorchards reaches my nostrils; I turn round, and there, there in frontof me, I see row upon row of richly-laden fruit trees, their leaves abrilliant copper in the scintillating rays of the ruddy autumn sun. Igasp for breath--the beauty of tint and tone surpasses all that I havehitherto seen--it is sublime, the grand climax of transformation. Asthe curtain falls with the approach of winter, I hurry to my Edinburghhome and pray for the prompt return of early spring.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]For many years my aged relatives, the Misses Amelia and DeborahHarbordeens, lived at Hennersley. Rarest and kindest of old ladies,they were the human prototypes of the flowers both they and I loved.Miss Amelia, with her beautiful complexion, rounded form and regalmien, suggested to my childish mind more, much more, than the meresemblance of a rose, whilst Miss Deborah, with her sprightly grace andgolden hair, was only masquerading as a woman--she was in reality adaffodil.Unlike so many of the fair sex who go in for gardening, my aunts wereessentially dainty. Their figures were shapely and elegant, their
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]hands slim and soft. I never saw them working without gloves, and Ihave good reason to believe they anointed their fingers every nightwith a special preparation to keep them smooth and white. They werenot--decidedly not--[DIALOGUE]"brainy," neither were they accomplished, neverhaving made any special study of the higher arts; but they evincednevertheless the keenest appreciation of painting, music, andliterature. Their library--a large one--boasted a delightfulharbourage of such writers as Jane Austen, Miss Mitford, and MariaEdgeworth. And in their drawing-room, on the walls of which art was
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]represented by the old as well as modern masters, might be seen andsometimes heard--for the Misses Harbordeens often entertained--awell-tuned Broadwood, and a Bucksen harpsichord. I will describe thisold-world abode, not as I first saw it, for when I first visited myaunts Amelia and Deborah, I was only one year old, but as I firstremember it--a house with the glamour of a many-gabled roof anddiamond window-panes.The house stood by the side of the turnpike road--that broad, white,interminable road, originating from goodness knows where in the north,and passing through Ayr--the nearest town of any importance--togoodness knows where in the south. A shady avenue, entered by a woodenswing gate bearing the superscription [DIALOGUE]"Hennersley" in neat, whiteletters, led by a circuitous route to it, and not a vestige of itcould be seen from the road. In front of it stretched a spacious lawn,
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION]flanked on either side and at the farthest extremity by a thick growthof chestnuts, beeches, poplars, and evergreens.The house itself was curiously built. It consisted of two storeys, andformed a main building and one wing, which gave it a peculiarlylop-sided appearance that reminded me somewhat ludicrously ofChanticleer, with a solitary, scant, and clipped appendage.It was often on the tip of my tongue to ask my relatives the reason ofthis singular disparity; whether it was the result of a mere whim onthe part of the architect, or whether it had been caused by somecatastrophe; but my curiosity was always held in check by a strangefeeling that my relatives would not like to be approached on thesubject. My aunts Amelia and Deborah belonged to that class of
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][METAPHOR]people, unhappily rare, who possess a power of generating in others aninstinctive knowledge of [DIALOGUE]"dangerous ground"--a power which enabledthem to avert, both from themselves and the might-be offender, many apainful situation. To proceed--the nakedness of the walls ofHennersley was veiled--who shall say it was not designedly veiled--bya thick covering of clematis and ivy, and in the latter innumerablespecimens of the feathered tribe found a sure and safe retreat.On entering the house, one stepped at once into a large hall. Agallery ran round it, and from the centre rose a broad oak staircase.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE]The rooms, with one or two exceptions, opened into one another, andwere large, and low and long in shape; the walls and floors were ofoak and the ceilings were crossed by ponderous oak beams.The fireplaces, too, were of the oldest fashion; and in theircomfortable ingle-nook my aunts--in the winter--loved to read or knit.When the warm weather came, they made similar use of the deep-setwindow-sills, over which they indulgently permitted me to scramble onto the lawn.The sunlight was a special feature of Hennersley. Forcing its waythrough the trellised panes, it illuminated the house with a radiancy,a soft golden radiancy I have never seen elsewhere.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE]My relatives seemed to possess some phenomenal attraction for thesunlight, for, no matter where they sat, a beam brighter than the restalways shone on them; and, when they got up, I noticed that it alwaysfollowed them, accompanying them from room to room and along thecorridors.But this was only one of the many pleasant mysteries that added to thejoy of my visits to Hennersley. I felt sure that the house wasenchanted--that it was under the control of some benevolent being whotook a kindly interest in the welfare of my relatives.I remember once, on the occasion of my customary good-morning to MissAmelia, who invariably breakfasted in bed, I inhaled the mostdelicious odour of heliotrope. It was wafted towards me, in a cool
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][EMOTION]current of air, as I approached her bed, and seemed, to my childishfancy, to be the friendly greeting of a sparkling sunbeam that restedon Miss Amelia's pillow.I was so charmed with the scent, that, alas! forgetful of my manners,I gave a loud sniff, and with a rapturous smile ejaculated, [DIALOGUE]"Oh!Auntie! Cherry pie!"Miss Amelia started. [DIALOGUE]"Dear me, child!" she exclaimed, "how quietly youentered. I had no idea you were in the room. Heliotrope is the name of
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE]the scent, my dear, but please do not allude to it again. Your AuntDeborah and I are very fond of it[DIALOGUE]"--here she sighed--"but for certainreasons--reasons you would not understand--we do not like to hear theword heliotrope mentioned. Kiss me, dear, and run away to yourbreakfast."For the first time in my life, perhaps, I was greatly puzzled. I couldnot see why I should be forbidden to refer to such a pleasant andharmless subject--a subject that, looked at from no matter what pointof view, did not appear to me to be in the slightest degreeindelicate. The more I thought over it, the more convinced I becamethat there was some association between the scent and the sunbeam,and in that association I felt sure much of the mystery lay.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][HAUNTED HOUSE]The house was haunted--agreeably, delightfully haunted by a goldenlight, a perfumed radiant light that could only have in my mind oneorigin, one creator--Titania--Titania, queen of the fairies, theguardian angel of my aged, my extremely aged relatives.[DIALOGUE]"Aunt Deborah," I said one morning, as I found her seated in theembrasure of the breakfast room window crocheting, [DIALOGUE]"Aunt Deborah! Youlove the sunlight, do you not?"She turned on me a startled face. [DIALOGUE]"What makes you ask such strangequestions, child?" she said. [DIALOGUE]"Of course I like the--sun. Most peopledo. It is no uncommon thing, especially at my age."[DIALOGUE]"But the sunbeams do not follow every one, auntie, do they?" Ipersisted.Miss Deborah's crochet fell into her lap.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][DIALOGUE]"How queerly you talk," she said, with a curious trembling of herlips. [DIALOGUE]"How can the sunbeams follow one?"[DIALOGUE]"But they do, auntie, they do indeed!" I cried. [DIALOGUE]"I have often watcheda bright beam of golden light follow Aunt Amelia and you, indifferent parts of the room. And it has settled on your lace collarnow."Miss Deborah looked at me very seriously; but the moistening of hereyes I attributed to the strong light. [DIALOGUE]"Esther," she said, laying oneof her soft hands on my forehead, [DIALOGUE]"there are things God does not wantlittle girls to understand--question me no more."I obeyed, but henceforth I felt more than ever assured that my aunts,consciously or unconsciously, shared their charming abode with somecapricious genii, of whose presence in their midst I had becomeaccidentally aware; and to find out the enchanted neighbourhood of itsmysterious retreat was to me now a matter of all-absorbing importance.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][DANGER][METAPHOR][PROBLEM]I spent hour after hour roaming through the corridors, the copses, andmy beloved flower gardens, in eager search of some spot I couldunhesitatingly affirm was the home of the genii. Most ardently I thenhoped that the sunbeams would follow me, and that the breeze chargedwith cool heliotrope would greet me as it did Aunt Deborah.In the daytime, all Hennersley was sunshine and flowers, and, straywhere I would, I never felt lonely or afraid; but as the light waned Isaw and felt a subtle change creep over everything. The long aisles oftrees that in the morning only struck me as enchantingly peaceful andshady, gradually filled with strangely terrifying shadows; the hue ofthe broad swards deepened into a darkness I did not dare interpret,whilst in the house, in its every passage, nook, and corner, a gloomarose that, seeming to come from the very bowels of the earth, broughtwith it every possible suggestion of bogey.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]I never spoke of these things to my relatives, partly because I wasashamed of my cowardice, and partly because I dreaded a fresh rebuke.How I suffered! and how I ridiculed my sufferings in the mornings,when every trace of darkness was obliterated, and amid the radiantbloom of the trees I thought only of heliotrope and sunbeams.One afternoon my search for the abode of the genii led me to thewingless side of the house, a side I rarely visited. At the foot ofthe ivy-covered walls and straight in their centre was laid a widebed of flowers, every one of which was white. But why white? Again
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][SUSPENSE]and again I asked myself this question, but I dared not broach it tomy relatives. A garden all white was assuredly an enigma--and to everyenigma there is undoubtedly a key. Was this garden, which was allwhite, in any way connected with the sunbeams and heliotrope? Was itanother of the mysteries God concealed from little girls? Could this
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][PERSPECTIVE][SURPRISE]be the home of the genii? This latter idea had no sooner entered myhead than it became a conviction. Of course! There was no doubtwhatever--it was the home of the genii.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][SURPRISE]The white petals were now a source of peculiar interest to me. I wasfascinated: the minutes sped by and still I was there. It was notuntil the sun had disappeared in the far-distant horizon, and the grimshadows of twilight were creeping out upon me from the neighbouringtrees and bushes, that I awoke from my reverie--and fled!That night--unable to sleep through the excitement caused by mydiscovery of the home of the genii--I lay awake, my whole thoughtsconcentrated in one soul-absorbing desire, the passionate desire tosee the fairy of Hennersley--I had never heard of ghosts--and hear itsstory. My bedroom was half-way down the corridor leading from the head
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][DANGER][PROBLEM][CONTEXT][PERSPECTIVE][TRANSITION]of the main staircase to the extremity of the wing.After I said good-night I did not see my aunts again till themorning--they never by any chance visited me after I was in bed. HenceI knew, when I had retired for the night, I should not see a humanface nor hear a human voice for nearly twelve hours. This--when Ithought of the genii with its golden beams of light and scent ofheliotrope--did not trouble me; it was only when my thoughts would notrun in this channel that I felt any fear, and that fear was not of thedarkness itself, but of what the darkness suggested.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]On this particular night, for the first few hours, I was sublimelyhappy, and then a strange restlessness seized me. I was obsessed witha wish to see the flower-garden. For some minutes, stimulated by adread of what my aunts would think of such a violation ofconventionality on the part of a child, I combated furiously with thedesire; but at length the longing was so great, so utterly and whollyirresistible, that I succumbed, and, getting quietly out of bed, mademy way noiselessly into the corridor.All was dark and still--stiller than I had ever known it before.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][HORROR]Without any hesitation I plunged forward, in the direction of thewingless side of the house, where there was a long, narrow, stainedwindow that commanded an immediate prospect of the white garden.I had seldom looked out of it, as up to the present this side of thehouse had little attraction for me; but all was changed now; and, as Ifelt my way cautiously along the corridor, a thousand and one fancifulnotions of what I might see surged through my brain.I came to the end of the corridor, I descended half a dozen stairs, Igot to the middle of the gallery overlooking the large entrancehall--below me, above me, on all sides of me, was Stygian darkness. Istopped, and there suddenly rang out, apparently from close at hand, aloud, clear, most appallingly clear, blood-curdling cry, which,beginning in a low key, ended in a shriek so horrid, harsh, andpiercing, that I felt my heart shrivel up within me, and in sheerdesperation I buried my fingers in my ears to deaden the sound.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SUSPENSE][EMOTION][CONFLICT][DANGER][PROBLEM]I was now too frightened to move one way or the other. All thestrength departed from my limbs, and when I endeavoured to move myfeet, I could not--they appeared to be fastened to the ground withlead weights.I felt, I intuitively felt that the author of the disturbance wasregarding my terror with grim satisfaction, and that it was merelypostponing further action in order to enjoy my suspense. To block outthe sight of this dreadful creature, I clenched my eyelids tightlytogether, at the same time earnestly imploring God to help me.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]Suddenly I heard the low wail begin again, and then the echo of afar-off silvery voice came softly to me through the gloom: [DIALOGUE]"It's anowl--only an owl!"With lightning-like rapidity the truth then dawned on me, and as Iwithdrew my clammy finger-tips from my ears, the faint fluttering ofwings reached me, through an open skylight. Once again I moved on;the gallery was left behind, and I was well on my way down thetortuous passage leading to my goal, when a luminous object, of vastheight and cylindrical shape, suddenly barred my progress.Overcome by a deadly sickness, I sank on the floor, and, burying myface in my hands, quite made up my mind that my last moments had come.How long I remained in this position I cannot say, to me it seemedeternity. I was eventually freed from it by the echo of a gentle
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]laugh, so kind, and gay, and girlish, that my terror at once departed,and, on raising my head, I perceived that the cause of my panic wasnothing more than a broad beam of moonlight on a particularlyprominent angle of the wall.Heartily ashamed at my cowardice, I got up, and, stepping brisklyforward, soon reached the stained-glass window.Pressing my face against the pane, I peered through it, and thereimmediately beneath me lay the flowers, glorified into dazzling goldby the yellow colour of the glass. The sight thrilled me with joy--itwas sublime. My instinct had not deceived me, this was indeed the
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][TRANSITION]long-looked-for home of the genii.The temperature, which had been high, abnormally so for June, nowunderwent an abrupt change, and a chill current of air, sweeping downon me from the rear, made my teeth chatter. I involuntarily shrankback from the window, and, as I did so, to my utter astonishment itdisappeared, and I saw, in its place, a room.It was a long, low room, and opposite to me, at the farthestextremity, was a large bay window, through which I could see thenodding tops of the trees. The furniture was all green and of a
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CHARACTER][FLASHBACK]lighter, daintier make than any I had hitherto seen. The walls werecovered with pictures, the mantelshelf with flowers. Whilst I wasbusily employed noting all these details, the door of the room opened,and the threshold was gorgeously illuminated by a brilliant sunbeam,from which suddenly evolved the figure of a young and lovely girl.I can see her now as I saw her then--tall, and slender, with massesof golden hair, waved artistically aside from a low forehead ofsnowy white; finely-pencilled brows, and long eyes of the mostlustrous violet; a straight, delicately-moulded nose, a firm,beautifully-proportioned chin, and a bewitching mouth. At her bosom
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][HORROR]was a bunch of heliotrope, which, deftly undoing, she raised to hernose and then laughingly held out to me. I was charmed; I took a stepforward towards her. The instant I did so, a wild look of terrordistorted her face, she waved me back, something jarred against myknee, and, in the place of the room, I saw only the blurred outlineof trees through the yellow window-panes.Bitterly disappointed, but absolutely sure that what I had seen wasobjective, I retraced my steps to my bedroom and passed the remainderof the night in sound sleep.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]After breakfast, however, unable to restrain my curiosity longer, Isought Miss Amelia, who was easier to approach than her sister, and,managing after several efforts to screw up courage, blurted out thestory of my nocturnal escapade.My aunt listened in silence. She was always gentle, but on thisoccasion she surpassed herself.[DIALOGUE]"I am not going to scold you, Esther," she said, smoothing out mycurls. "After what you have seen it is useless to conceal the truthfrom you. God perhaps intends you to know all. Years ago, Esther, this
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][TRANSITION]house was not as you see it now. It had two wings, and, in the onethat no longer exists was the bedroom you saw in your vision. Wecalled it the Green Room because everything in it was green, your AuntAlicia--an aunt you have never heard of--who slept there, having apeculiar fancy for that colour."Alicia was our youngest sister, and we all loved her dearly. She was
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][DANGER][CHARACTERIZATION][EMOTION][FLASHBACK][WITCH]just as you describe her--beautiful as a fairy, with golden hair, andviolet eyes, and she always wore a bunch of heliotrope in her dress."One night, Esther, one lovely, calm, midsummer night, forty yearsago, this house was broken into by burglars. They got in through theGreen Room window, which was always left open during the warmweather. We--my mother, your Aunt Deborah, and I--were awakened by aloud shriek for help. Recognising Alicia's voice, we instantly flew
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][DEATH][DANGER][ACTION][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][MURDER]out of bed, and, summoning the servants, tore to the Green Room asfast as we could."To our horror, Esther, the door was locked, and before we could breakthe lock the ruffians had murdered her! They escaped through thewindow and were never caught. My mother, your great-grandmother, hadthat part of the house pulled down, and on the site of it she plantedthe white garden.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][DIALOGUE]"Though Alicia's earthly body died, and was taken from us, herbeautiful spirit remains with us here. It follows us about in thedaytime in the form of a sunbeam, whilst occasionally, at night, itassumes her earthly shape. The house is what is generally termedhaunted, and, no doubt, some people would be afraid to live in it. Butthat, Esther, is because they do not understand spirits--your AuntDeborah and I do."[DIALOGUE]"Do you think, auntie," I asked with a thrill of joy, [DIALOGUE]"do you think itat all likely that I shall see Aunt Alicia again to-night?"Aunt Amelia shook her head gently. [DIALOGUE]"No, my dear," she said slowly, [DIALOGUE]"Ithink it will be impossible, because you are going home thisafternoon."                          CASE X    [DIALOGUE]"---- HOUSE," NEAR BLYTHSWOOD SQUARE, GLASGOW.      THE HAUNTED BATHWhen Captain W. de S. Smythe went to look over [DIALOGUE]"---- House," in the
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][CHARACTERIZATION][METAPHOR][PERSPECTIVE][EMOTION]neighbourhood of Blythswood Square, Glasgow, the only thing about thehouse he did not like was the bathroom--it struck him as excessivelygrim. The secret of the grimness did not lie, he thought, in any oneparticular feature--in the tall, gaunt geyser, for example (thoughthere was always something in the look of a geyser when it was old anddilapidated, as was the case with this one, that repelled him), or inthe dark drying-cupboard, or in the narrow, slit-like window; but inthe room as a whole, in its atmosphere and general appearance. Hecould not diagnose it; he could not associate it with anything else hehad ever experienced; it was a grimness that he could only specify asgrim--grim with a grimness that made him feel he should not like tobe alone there in the dead of night. It was a nuisance, because therest of the house pleased him; moreover, the locality was convenient,and the rent moderate, very moderate for such a neighbourhood. He
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][DANGER][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][HORROR]thought the matter well over as he leaned in the doorway of thebathroom. He could, of course, have the room completely renovated--newpaper, new paint, and a fresh bath. Hot-water pipes! The geyser shouldbe done away with. Geysers were hideous, dangerous, and--pshaw, what
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][DANGER][HORROR]nonsense!--Ghostly! Ghostly! What absurd rot! How his wife would
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][RESOLUTION][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][CONFLICT][TRANSITION]laugh! That decided the question. His wife! She had expressed a veryardent wish that he should take a house in or near Blythswood Square,if he could get one on anything like reasonable terms, and here washis chance. He would accompany the agent of the property to the
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]latter's office, and the preliminaries should be forthwith settled.Six weeks later, he and his family were installed in the house, whichstill reeked with the smell of fresh paint and paper. The first thingthe Captain did when he got there was to steal away slyly to thebathroom, and as soon as he opened the door his heart sank. Despitethe many alterations the room had undergone, the grimness was stillthere--there, everywhere. In the fine new six-foot bath, with its
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CONFLICT][EMOTION][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][DANGER][FLASHBACK][TRANSITION][HORROR]glistening, gleaming, wooden framework; in the newly papered, newlypainted cupboard; in the walls, with their bright, fresh paper; inthe snowy surface of the whitewashed ceiling; in the air,--the veryair itself was full of it. The Captain was, as a rule, very fond ofhis bath, but in his new quarters he firmly resolved that some oneelse should use the bath before he made the experiment. In a very fewdays the family had all settled down, and every one, with theexception of the Captain, had had a bath, but no matter how many andhow bitter were his wife's complaints, try how he would, he couldnot, he positively _could_ not, bring himself to wash in thebathroom--_alone_. It was all right so long as the door was open, buthis wife resolutely refused to allow him to keep it open, and themoment it was shut his abject terror returned--a terror produced bynothing that he could in any way analyse or define. At last, ashamed
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]of his cowardice, he screwed up courage, and, with a look ofdetermined desperation in his eyes and mouth--an expression whichsent his wife into fits of laughter--set out one night from hisbedroom, candle in hand, and entered the bathroom. Shutting andlocking the door, he lighted another candle, and, after placing themboth on the mantelshelf, turned on the bath water, and began toundress.[DIALOGUE]"I may as well have a peep in the cupboard," he said, [DIALOGUE]"just to satisfymyself no one is hiding there--for every one in the house knows how Ihate this beastly bathroom--with the intention of playing me apractical joke. Supposing one of the maids--Polly, for example, I'msure she'd be quite capable--took it into her pretty head to"--buthere the Captain was obliged to stop; he really was not equal tofacing, even in his mind's eye, the situation such a suppositioninvolved, and at the bare idea of such a thing his countenance assumeda deeper hue, and--I am loth to admit--an amused grin. The grin,however, died out as he cautiously opened the door and peeredfurtively in; no one--nothing was there! With a breath of relief he
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][EMOTION][ACTION]closed the door again, placed a chair against it, and, sitting down,proceeded to pull off his clothes. Coat, vest, under-garments, heplaced them all tenderly in an untidy heap on the floor, and then,with a last lingering, affectionate look at them, walked sedatelytowards the bath. But this sedateness was only momentary. The firstfew steps he walked, but, a noise in the grate startling him, hesuddenly assumed an air of the greatest gaiety, and, bowing with mockgallantry to his trousers, he now waltzed coquettishly to the bath. It
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][EMOTION][DANGER][HORROR]was grim, horribly grim, and horribly hot too, for, when he felt thetemperature with one of his squat, podgy toes, it made him swear quiteinvoluntarily. Turning on the cold water, and slapping his thighsplayfully, he felt again. Too hot yet, far too hot even for him! Heloved heat. More cold! and he was hoisting one chubby leg to feel
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][EMOTION][METAPHOR][CONFLICT][DANGER][HORROR]again, when, a repetition of the noise in the grate making him swinground, he lost his balance, and descended on the floor with a hard, avery hard, bump. For some seconds he lay still, too sulky andaggrieved even to get up, but, the draught from under the ill-fittingdoor tickling his bare flesh in the most immodest fashion, he rousedhimself from this lethargy, and was about to raise himself from thefloor, when the lights went out--went out without a moment's warning,and he found himself engulfed in the most funereal darkness. To say hewas startled is to put it very mildly--he was absolutelyterror-stricken--far too terror-stricken to think of moving now, andleast of all of getting up and groping for the matches. Indeed, whenhe came to think of it, he had not seen any matches in the room, andhe had not brought any with him, his wife had flurried him so much.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][PERSPECTIVE][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][HORROR]The moment the candles were extinguished the grimness sensiblyincreased, and he could feel all around him, thickly amalgamated withthe ether, a superphysical presence, at once hostile and horrible.Then, to bring his terror to a climax, there issued from the bath aloud rubbing and splashing, as if some one, some very heavy person,was vigorously washing. The water rose and fell, squished and bubbledas it does when one is lying at full length in it, raising andlowering oneself, kicking and plunging first on one side and then onthe other. Whilst, to add to the realism, Captain Smythe distinctlyheard gasping and puffing; and the soft, greasy sound of a well-soapedflannel. He could indeed follow every movement of the occupant of the
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CONFLICT][ACTION]bath as graphically as if he had seen him--from the brisk scrubbing ofbody and legs to the finicky process of cleaning the ears and toes.It was whilst the bather was occupied thus that the cupboard doorbegan to open very quietly and stealthily, and Captain de Smythe heardthe chair he had so carefully placed against it being graduallypropelled across the floor.Then something, he would have given anything to tell what, came outand began to steal towards him. He tried to crawl out of its way, butcould not; his limbs no longer acted conjointly with his brain, andwhen he opened his mouth to shout at it, his voice withered away inhis throat. It came up to him, and directly it touched his naked skin
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][DANGER][CONFLICT][MURDER]he knew it was a woman--a woman with a much-beflounced silk skirt andsilk petticoats--a woman whose person was perfumed with violets (ascent for which the Captain had a particular weakness), and withoutdoubt, loaded with jewellery. Her behaviour did not betray anysymptoms of embarrassment when she encountered the Captain lying onthe floor, but, planting one icy-cold high-heeled shoe on his chestand the other on his cheek, she stepped on him as if he had been anorthodox cushion or footstool, purposely placed there for herconvenience. A hollow exclamation, which died away in a gasp, issuedfrom the bath, as the woman, with a swift movement of her arms, threwsomething over it. What followed, the Captain could only surmise, butfrom the muttered imprecations and splashes in the water, it seemed tohim that nothing short of murder was taking place. After a while the
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][HORROR]noises in the bath grew feebler and feebler, and when they finallyceased, the woman, with a sigh of relief, shook the water from herarms, and, stepping off the Captain, moved towards the fireplace. Thespell which had, up to the present, enthralled the unfortunateCaptain, was now broken, and, thinking that his ghostly visitor hadbetaken herself right away, he sat up. He had hardly done so beforethe darkness was rudely dissipated, and, to his horror, he sawlooking at him, from a distance of only a few feet, a white, luminousface, presumably that of a woman. But what a woman! What a
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][METAPHOR]devil!--what a match for the most lurid of any of Satan's maleretainers. Yet she was not without beauty--beauty of the richestsensual order; beauty that, had it been flesh and blood, would havesent men mad. Her hair, jet black, wavy, and parted in the centre, waslooped over her shell-like ears, which were set unusually low and farback on her head; her nose was of that rare and matchless shape termedGrecian; and her mouth--in form, a triumph of all things heavenly, inexpression, a triumph of all things hellish. The magnificent turn of
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]its short upper lip, and the soft voluptuous line of its under lip;its sportive dimples and ripe red colour; its even rows of dazzling,pearly teeth were adorable; but they appealed to the senses, and in nosense or shape to the soul. Her brows, slightly irregular in outline,met over the nose; her eyelashes were of great length, and hereyes--slightly, ever so slightly, obliquely set, and larger than thoseof living human beings--were black, black as her hair; and the pupilssparkled and shone with the most damnable expression of satanicalhatred and glee. The whole thing, the face and the light that emanatedfrom it, was so entirely awful and devilish, that Captain Smythe satlike one turned to stone, and it was not until long after it hadvanished that he groped his way to the door, and in Adam's costume,for he dared not stay to put on his clothes, fled down the passage tohis bedroom.From his wife he got little sympathy; her sarcasm was too deep forwords, and she merely ordered her husband on no account to breathe aword of his [DIALOGUE]"silliness" before either the children or the servants.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][DANGER][HORROR]The injunction, however, which was naturally carried out to theletter, was futile as a precaution, for, on running into the bathroomone morning when every one else was downstairs, the eldest boy,Ronald, saw, floating in the bath, the body of a hoary-headed old man.It was bloated and purplish blue, and had big, glassy eyes that staredat him in such a hideous, meaningless manner that he uttered a screamof terror and fled. Alarmed at the noise, most of the household ran tosee what had happened. Only the Captain remained behind. He knew only
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]too well, and he hid, letting his wife and the servants go upstairsalone. They entered the bathroom--there was nothing in the bath, noteven water, but, as they were leaving, they ran into a dark, handsome,evil-eyed woman, clad in the most costly of dresses, and sparklingwith jewellery. She glided past them with sly, silent footsteps, andvanished by the cupboard. Cured of scepticism, and throwing dignity tothe wind, the Captain's wife raced downstairs, and, bursting into thedrawing-room, flung herself on the sofa in hysterics.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]Within a week the house was once again empty, and the rumour gettingabout that it was haunted, the landlord threatened the Smythes with anaction for slander of title. But I do not think the case was taken tocourt, the Smythes agreeing to contradict the report they hadoriginated. Astute inquiries, however, eventually led them to discoverthat a lady, answering to the description of the ghost they had seen,had once lived at ---- House. Of Spanish descent, she was young,beautiful, and gay; and was married to a man, an extremely wealthy man(people remembered how rich he was after he died), old enough to beher grandfather. They had nothing in common, the husband only wanting
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CONFLICT][MURDER]to be quiet, the wife to flirt and be admired. Their neighbours oftenheard them quarrel, and it was declared that the wife possessed thetemper of a fiend. The man was eventually found dead in his bath, andthere being no indications of violence, it was generally supposed thathe had fainted, (his wife having been previously heard to declare thathe often had fainting fits), and had thus been accidentally drowned.The beautiful young widow, who inherited all his money, left the houseimmediately and went abroad, and the neighbours, when questioned bythe Smythes as to whether anything had been seen of her since, shooktheir heads dubiously, but refused to commit themselves.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CHARACTER][HAUNTED HOUSE]                         CASE XI    THE CHOKING GHOST OF [DIALOGUE]"---- HOUSE," NEAR      SANDYFORD PLACE, GLASGOWThe last time I was passing through Glasgow, I put up for the night atan hotel near Sandyford Place, and met there an old theatricalacquaintance named Browne, Hely Browne. Not having seen him since Igave up acting, which is now, alas! a good many years, we had much todiscuss--touring days, lodgings, managers, crowds, and a dozen othersubjects, all included in the vulgar term [DIALOGUE]"shop." We spent the wholeof one evening debating thus, in the smoke-room; whilst the followingnight we went to an entertainment given by that charming reciter andraconteur, Miss Lilian North, who, apart from her talent, which, in myopinion, places her in the first rank of her profession, is thepossessor of extraordinary personal attractions, not the leastremarkable of which are her hands. Indeed, it was through my attentionbeing called to the latter, that I am indirectly indebted for thisstory. Miss North has typically psychic hands--exquisitely white and
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][HAUNTED HOUSE]narrow, and her long, tapering fingers and filbert nails (which, bythe way, are always trimly manicured) are the most perfect I have everseen. I was alluding to them, on our way back to the hotel after herperformance, when Hely Browne interrupted me.[DIALOGUE]"Talking about psychic things, O'Donnell," he said, "do you know thereis a haunted house near where we are staying? You don't? Very well,then, if I tell you what I know and you write about it, will youpromise not to allude to the house by its right number? If you do,
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][FLASHBACK][METAPHOR][HAUNTED HOUSE]there will be the dickens to pay--simply call it '---- House,' nearSandyford Place. You promise? Good! Let us take a little stroll beforewe turn in--I feel I want a breath of fresh air--and I will tell youthe experience I once had there. It is exactly two years ago, and I
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE]was on tour here in _The Green Bushes_. All the usual theatrical'diggings' had been snapped up long before I arrived, and, notknowing where else to go, I went to No.--Sandyford Place, which I sawadvertised in one of the local papers as a first-class private hotelwith very moderate charges. A wild bit of extravagance, eh? But then
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][HORROR]one does do foolish things sometimes, and, to tell the truth, I wanteda change badly. I had 'digged' for a long time with a fellow calledCharlie Grosvenor. Not at all a bad chap, but rather apt to get onone's nerves after a while--and he had got on mine--horribly.Consequently, I was not at all sorry for an excuse to get away fromhim for a bit, even though I had to pay dearly for it. A private hotel
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][HORROR]in a neighbourhood like that of Sandyford Place is a big order for anordinary comedian. I forget exactly what the terms were, but I know Ipulled rather a long face when I was told. Still, being, as I say,tired of the usual 'digs,' I determined to try it, and accordinglyfound myself landed in a nice-sized bedroom on the second floor. Thefirst three nights passed, and nothing happened, saving that I had themost diabolical nightmares--a very unusual thing for me. 'It was the
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][PROBLEM][DANGER][FLASHBACK][HORROR]cheese,' I said to myself, when I got out of bed the first morning; 'Iwill take very good care I don't touch cheese to-night.' I kept thisresolution, but I had the nightmare again, and even, if anything,worse than before. Then I fancied it must be cocoa--I was at that timea teetotaller--so I took hot milk instead; but I had nightmare all thesame, and my dreams terrified me to such an extent that I did not dareget out of bed in the morning (it was then winter) till it was broaddaylight. It was now becoming a serious matter with me. As you know,
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]an actor more than most people needs sleep, and it soon became as muchas I could do to maintain my usual standard of acting. On the fourthnight, determining to get rest at all costs, I took a stiff glass ofhot brandy just before getting into bed. I slept,--I could scarcelyhelp sleeping,--but not for long, for I was rudely awakened from myslumbers by a loud crash. I sat up in bed, thinking the whole housewas falling about my ears. The sound was not repeated, and all was
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]profoundly silent. Wondering what on earth the noise could have been,and feeling very thirsty, I got out of bed to get a drink oflime-juice. To my annoyance, however, though I groped abouteverywhere, knocking an ash tray off the mantelpiece and smashing thelid of the soap-dish, I could find neither the lime-juice nor matches.At length, giving it up as a bad job, I decided to get into bed again.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][METAPHOR][COMEDIC HORROR]With that end in view, I groped my way through the darkness, steeringmyself by the furniture, the position of which was, of course, quitefamiliar to me--at least I imagined it was. Judge, then, of myastonishment when I could not find the bed! At first I regarded it asa huge joke, and laughed--how rich! Ha! ha! ha! Fancy not being able
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][RELIEF][TRANSITION][FLASHBACK][CLIMAX][RESOLUTION][METAPHOR][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][WEAPON][CHARACTERIZATION][HORROR]to find one's way back to bed in a room of this dimension! Good enoughfor _Punch_! Too good, perhaps, now. Ha! ha! ha! But it soon grew past
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][METAPHOR][SURPRISE][CHARACTERIZATION][SUSPENSE][PLOT][EXPOSITION][PERSPECTIVE][FLASHBACK][EMOTION][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][SETTING][CHARACTER][CONTEXT][COMEDIC HORROR]a joke. I had been round the room, completely round the room, twice,and still no bed! I became seriously alarmed! Could I be ill? Was I
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE]going mad? But no, my forehead was cool, my pulse normal. For someseconds I stood still, not knowing what else to do; then, to make onemore desperate attempt, I stuck straight in front of me--and--raninto something--something that recoiled and hit me. Thrilled withamazement, I put up my hand to feel what it was, and touched a noose."
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][SURPRISE][DIALOGUE]"A noose!" I ejaculated, interrupting Hely Browne for the first timesince he began.[DIALOGUE]"Yes, a noose!" he repeated, "suspended in mid-air. As you canimagine, I was greatly astonished, for I knew there had been nothingthat I could be now mistaking for a noose in the room overnight. Istretched out my arms to feel to what it was fastened, but, to add tomy surprise, the cord terminated in thin air. Then I grew frightened,and, dropping my arms, tried to move away from the spot; I couldnot--my feet were glued to the floor. With a gentle, purring sound
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][ACTION][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][DANGER][HORROR]the noose commenced fawning--I use that word because the action wasso intensely bestial, so like that of a cat or snake--round my neckand face. It then rose above me, and, after circling furiously roundand round and creating a miniature maelstrom in the air, descendedgradually over my head. Lower and lower it stole, like some sleek,caressing slug. Now past the tips of my ears, now my nose, now mychin, until with a tiny thud it landed on my shoulders, when, with afierce snap, it suddenly tightened. I endeavoured to tear it off, but
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][DANGER][PROBLEM][HORROR]every time I raised my hands, a strong, magnetic force drew them tomy side again; I opened my mouth to shriek for help, and an icycurrent of air froze the breath in my lungs. I was helpless,O'Donnell, utterly, wholly helpless. Cold, clammy hands tore my feetfrom the floor; I was hoisted bodily up, and then let drop. Afrightful pain shot through me. A hundred wires cut into my throat at
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][DANGER]once. I gasped, choked, suffocated, and in my mad efforts to find afoothold kicked out frantically in all directions. But this onlyresulted in an increase of my torments, since with every plunge thenoose grew tauter. My agony at last grew unbearable; I could feel thesides of my raw and palpitating thorax driven into one another, whileevery attempt to heave up breath from my bursting lungs was rewardedwith the most excruciating paroxysms of pain--pain more acute than Ithought it possible for any human being to endure. My head became
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]ten times its natural size; blood--foaming, boiling blood--pouredinto it from God knows where, and under its pressure my eyes bulgedin their sockets, and the veins in my nose cracked. Terrificthunderings echoed and re-echoed in my ears; my tongue, huge as amountain, shot against my teeth; a sea of fire raged through mybrain, and then--blackness--blackness inconceivable. When I recoveredconsciousness, O'Donnell, I found myself standing, cold andshivering, but otherwise sound and whole, on the chilly oilcloth. Ihad, now, no difficulty in finding my way back to bed, and in aboutan hour's time succeeded in falling asleep. I slept till late, and,
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][HORROR]on getting up, tried to persuade myself that my horrible experiencewas but the result of another nightmare."As you may guess, after all this, I did not look forward to bedtime,and counted the minutes as they flew by with the utmost regret. Neverhad I been so sorry when my performance at the theatre was over, andthe lights of my hotel once again hove in sight. I entered my bedroomin fear and trembling, and was so apprehensive lest I should be againcompelled to undergo the sensations of hanging, that I decided to keepa light burning all night, and, for that reason, had bought half apound of wax candles. At last I grew so sleepy that I could keep awake
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE]no longer, and, placing the candlestick on a chair by the bed, Iscrambled in between the sheets. Without as much as a sip of spirits,I slept like a top. When I awoke the room was in pitch darkness. Acurious smell at once attracted my notice. I thought, at first, it
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][DANGER][EMOTION][FLASHBACK][CONFLICT][HORROR]might be but the passing illusion of a dream. But no--I sniffedagain--it was there--there, close to me--under my very nose--thestrong, pungent odour of drugs; but not being a professor of smells,nor even a humble student of physics, I was consequently unable todiagnose it, and could only arrive at the general conclusion that itwas a smell that brought with it very vivid recollections of achemist's shop and of my old school laboratory. Wondering whence itoriginated, I thrust my face forward with the intention of trying tolocate it, when, to my horror, my lips touched against something coldand flabby. In an agony of fear I reeled away from it, and, the bedbeing narrow, I slipped over the edge and bumped on to the floor.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][FLASHBACK]"Now I think it is quite possible that up to this point you may haveattributed my unhappy experience to nothing more nor less than a baddream, but your dream theory can no longer hold good, for, on comingin such sudden contact with the floor, I gave my funny-bone a knock,which, I can assure you, made me thoroughly awake, and the first thingI noticed on recovering my scattered senses--was the smell. I sat up,and saw to my terror my bed was occupied, but occupied in the mostalarming manner. On the middle of the pillow was a face, the faceof--I looked closer; I would have given every penny I possessed not tohave done so, but I could not help myself--I looked closer, and itwas--the face of my brother; my brother Ralph--you may recollect mymentioning him to you, for he was the only one of us who was at thattime making money--whom I believed to be in New York. He had alwaysbeen rather sallow, but apart from the fact that he now looked veryyellow, his appearance was quite natural. Indeed, as I gazed at him, I
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][DEATH][PROBLEM][EMOTION][VAMPIRE]grew so convinced it was he that I cried out, 'Ralph!' The moment Idid so, there was a ghastly change: his eyelids opened, and hiseyes--eyes I recognised at once--protruded to such a degree that theyalmost rolled out; his mouth flew open, his tongue swelled, his wholecountenance became convulsed with the most unparalleled, and for thatreason indescribable, expression of agony, whilst the yellowness ofhis complexion deepened to a livid, lurid black, that was soinconceivably repellent and hellish that I sprang away from thebed--appalled. There was then a gasping, rasping noise, and a voicethat, despite its unnatural hollowness, I identified as that of Ralph,broke forth: 'I have been wanting to speak to you for ages, but_something_, I cannot explain, has always prevented me. I have beendead a month; not cancer, but Dolly. Poison. Good-bye, Hely. I shall
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][CONFLICT]rest in peace now.' The voice stopped; there was a rush of cold air,laden with the scent of the drug, and tainted, faintly tainted, withthe nauseating smell of the grave, and--the face on the pillowvanished. How I got through the remainder of the night I cannot say--Idare not think. I dare only remember that I did not sleep. I was
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][DEATH][EMOTION]devoted to Ralph, and the thought that he had perished in themiserable manner suggested by the apparition, completely prostratedme. In the morning I received a black-edged letter from my mother,stating that she had just heard from Dolly, my brother's wife, sayingRalph had died from cancer in the throat. Dolly added in a postscriptthat her dearly beloved Ralph had been very good to her, and left herwell provided for. Of course, we might have had the body exhumed, butwe were poor, and Ralph's widow was rich; and in America, you know,everything goes in favour of the dollars. Hence we were obliged to let
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][HAUNTED HOUSE]the matter drop, sincerely trusting Dolly would never take it into herhead to visit us. She never did. My mother died last year--I felt herdeath terribly, O'Donnell; and as I no longer have any fixed abode,but am always touring the British provinces, there is not much fearof Ralph's murderess and I meeting. It is rather odd, however, thatafter my own experience at the hotel, I heard that it had borne thereputation for being haunted for many years, and that a good manyvisitors who had passed the night in one of the rooms (presumablymine) had complained of hearing strange noises and having dreadfuldreams. How can one explain it all?"
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][DIALOGUE]"One can't," I responded, as we turned in for the night.                         CASE XII    THE GREY PIPER AND THE HEAVY COACH OF      DONALDGOWERIE HOUSE, PERTHDonaldgowerie House, until comparatively recent times, stood on theoutskirts of Perth. It was a long, low, rambling old place, datingback to the beginning of the seventeenth century. At the time of thenarrative it was in the possession of a Mr. William Whittingen, whobought it at a very low price from some people named Tyler. It is true
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]that it would cost a small fortune to repair, but, notwithstandingthis disadvantage, Mr. Whittingen considered his purchase a bargain,and was more than satisfied with it. Indeed, he knew of no other houseof a similar size, of such an imposing appearance, and so pleasantlysituated, that he could have bought for less than twice the amount hehad paid for this; and he was really very sorry for the Tylers, whoexplained to him, in confidence, that had they not been in suchurgent need of money, they would never have sold Donaldgowerie Houseat such a ridiculously low figure. However, with them it was aquestion of cash--cash down, and Mr. Whittingen had only to write outa cheque for the modest sum they asked, and the house was his. It wasJune when Mr. Whittingen took possession of the house--June, when thesummer sun was brightest and the gardens looked their best. The
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]Whittingen family, consisting of Mr. and Mrs. Whittingen, two sons,Ernest and Harvey, and three daughters, Ruth, Martha, and Mary, were,as one might gather from their names alone, plain, practical, genteel,and in fact very superior people, who were by no means lacking in thatexceedingly useful quality of canniness, so characteristic of theLowland Scot to which race they belonged. Mr. Whittingen had, foryears, conducted a grocery business in Jedburgh, twice filling thehonoured and coveted post of mayor, and when he at length retired intoprivate life, his friends (and it was astonishing how many friends hehad) shrewdly suspected that his pockets were not only well lined butfull to bursting. Acting on the advice of his wife and daughters, whowere keen on social distinction, he sent Ernest to Oxford,conditionally that he should take Holy Orders in the Church ofEngland, whilst Harvey, who, when scarcely out of the petticoat stage,displayed the regular Whittingen talent for business by covertlyhelping himself to the sugar in his father's shop, and disposing of itat strictly sale price to his sisters' cronies in the nursery, wassent to one of those half preparatory and half finishing schools (ofcourse, for the sons of gentlemen only) at Edinburgh, where he waskept till he was old enough to be articled to a prosperous,exceedingly prosperous, firm of solicitors.The girls, Ruth, Martha, and Mary, had likewise been highly educated,that is to say, they had remained so many years at an English seminaryfor young ladies, and had been given a final twelve months in Franceand Germany to enable them to obtain [DIALOGUE]"the correct accent."At the time of the story they were as yet unmarried, and were awaitingwith the most laudable patience the advent of men of title. They were
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][METAPHOR][SURPRISE][CHARACTERIZATION][PERSPECTIVE]delighted with their new home (which Ruth had persuaded her father tochristen [DIALOGUE]"Donaldgowerie," after the house in a romantic novel she hadjust been reading), and proud of their gilded premises and magnificenttennis lawns; they had placed a gigantic and costly tray in the hall,in confident assurance that it would speedily groan beneath the weightof cards from all the gentry in Perthshire.But please be it understood, that my one and only object in alludingto these trifling details is to point out that the Whittingens, beingentirely engrossed in matters mundane, were the very last people inthe world to be termed superstitious, and although imaginative wherefuture husbands' calls and cards were concerned, prior to the eventsabout to be narrated had not an ounce of superstition in theirnatures. Indeed, until then they had always smiled in a verysupercilious manner at even the smallest mention of a ghost.September came, their first September in Donaldgowerie, and the familywelcomed with joy Ernest and his youthful bride.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][METAPHOR][CONTEXT][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][CHARACTERIZATION][RELIEF][EMOTION][ACTION][EXPOSITION]The latter was not, as they had fondly hoped (and roundly announced inPerth), the daughter of a Peer, but of a wealthy Bristol draper, theowner of a house near the Downs, whose son had been one of Ernest'smany friends at Oxford. The coming of the newly-married pair toDonaldgowerie brought with it a burst of bird-like gaiety. All sortsof entertainments--musical [DIALOGUE]"at homes," dinners, dances, tennis andgarden parties, in fact, every variety that accorded with the family'sidea of good taste--were given; and with praiseworthy [DIALOGUE]"push," forwhich the Whittingens had fast become noted, all the County wasinvited. This splendid display of wealth and hospitality was notdisinterested; I fear, it might be not only accounted a [DIALOGUE]"send off" forthe immaculately-clad curate and his wife, but also a determinedeffort on the part of Mr. and Mrs. Whittingen to attract the rightsort of lover for their girls. It was during the progress of one of
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]their alfresco entertainments that the scepticism of certain of theWhittingens with regard to the supernatural received a rude blow.Martha, Mary, and two eligible young men, friends of Harvey's, havingfinished a somewhat spirited game of croquet, were refreshingthemselves with lemonade, whilst they continued their flirtation.Presently Mary, whose partner declared how much he should like to seesome photographs she had recently had taken of herself, with awell-affected giggle of embarrassment set off to the house to fetchher album. The minutes passed, and, as she did not return, Martha wentin search of her. The album, she knew, was in their boudoir, which was
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][EMOTION]situated at the end of the long and rather gloomy corridor of theupper storey. Highly incensed at her sister's slowness, she washastening along the corridor, when, to her supreme astonishment, shesuddenly saw the figure of a man in kilts, with a bagpipe under hisarm, emerge through the half-open door of the boudoir, and with apeculiar gliding motion advance towards her. A curious feeling, withwhich she was totally unfamiliar, compelled her to remain mute andmotionless; and in this condition she awaited the approach of thestranger. Who was he? she asked herself, and how on earth had he got
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]there, and what was he doing? As he drew nearer, she perceived thathis face was all one hue,--a ghastly, livid grey,--and that his eyes,which were all the time fixed on hers, were lurid and menacing,--soterrible, in fact, that she turned cold with fear, and felt the veryhair on her head beginning to rise on end. She opened her mouth toshriek, but found she could not ejaculate a syllable; neither couldshe, even with the most desperate efforts, tear her feet from thefloor. On came the figure, and, without swerving either to the rightor left, it glided right up to and through her; and, as sheinvoluntarily turned round, she saw it disappear through a half-openstaircase window, at least twenty feet above the ground outside.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]Shaking all over with terror, and not understanding in the slightestwhat to make of it, Martha ran to the boudoir, where her heart almostsprang out of her body at the spectacle of her sister Mary stretchedat full length on the floor, her cheeks ashy pale, her lips blue.Martha at once made a frantic rush to the bell, and, in a few minutes,half the establishment, headed by Mr. Whittingen, poured into theroom. With the aid of a little cold water, Mary speedily recovered,and, in reply to the anxious inquiries of her sympathetic rescuers asto what had happened, indignantly demanded why such a horriblelooking creature as [DIALOGUE]"that" piper had been allowed not merely to enterthe house but to come up to her room, and half frighten her to death.[DIALOGUE]"I had just got my album," she added, "when, feeling some one was inthe room, I turned round--and there (she indicated a spot on thecarpet) was the piper, not ten paces away from me, regarding me withthe most awful look imaginable. I was too taken aback with surprise tosay anything, nor--for some unaccountable reason--could I escape,before he touched me on the shoulder with one of his icy cold hands,and then commenced playing. Up and down the floor he paced, backwards
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CONFLICT][DANGER][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][EMOTION][HORROR]and forwards, never taking his hateful glance off my face and everpiping the same dismal dirge. At last, unable to stand the strain ofit any longer, and convinced he was a madman, bent on murderingme--for who but a lunatic would behave in such a way?--I gave way to aviolent fit of hysterics, and fainted. Now tell me who he was, and whyhe was permitted to frighten me in this manner?" And Mary stamped her
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][EMOTION]feet and grew vicious, as only her class will when they are at allvexed. Her speech was followed by a silence that exasperated her. Sherepeated her inquiries with crimson cheeks, and then, as again no oneresponded, she signalled out the head footman and raved at him. Up tothis point Mr. Whittingen had been dumb with amazement. The idea of a
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][DANGER][EMOTION]strange piper having the twofold effrontery to enter his house andproceed to the private and chaste sanctuary of his highly respectabledaughters, almost deprived him of breath. He could scarcely believehis ears. [DIALOGUE]"What--what in the name of--what does it all mean?" he atlength stammered, addressing the unfortunate footman. "A piper! and
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]without any invitation from me, how dare you let him in?[DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE]""I did not, sir,[DIALOGUE]" the luckless footman replied; "no such person cameto the door when I was in the hall.""No more he did when I was there,[DIALOGUE]" chimed in the second footman, andall the other servants vociferated in a body, "We never saw any piper,sir, nor heard one either," and they looked at Mary reproachfully.At this Mr. Whittingen looked exceedingly embarrassed. In the face ofsuch a unanimous denial what could he say? He knew if he suggested
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CONFLICT]the servants were untruthful they would all give notice to leave onthe spot, and knowing good servants are scarce in Perth as elsewhere,he felt rather in a fix. At length, turning to Mary, he asked if shewas sure it was a piper. [DIALOGUE]"Sure!" Mary screamed, [DIALOGUE]"why, of course I am,did I not tell you he marched up and down here playing on hisdisgusting bagpipes, which nearly broke the drum of my ear."[DIALOGUE]"And I saw him too, pa," Martha put in. [DIALOGUE]"I met him in the corridor, hehad his pipes under his arm, and the most dreadful expression in hisface. I don't wonder Mary was frightened."[DIALOGUE]"But where did he go?" Mr. Whittingen cried.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][DIALOGUE]"You would not believe me if I told you," Martha said, her cheeksflushing. [DIALOGUE]"He seemed to pass right through me, and then to vanishthrough the staircase window. I have never been so terribly upset inmy life," and, sinking on to the sofa, she began to laughhysterically.[DIALOGUE]"Dear me! dear me! it is very odd!" Mr. Whittingen exclaimed, as Maryhanded her sister a wineglass of sal-volatile. "They can't both havebeen dreaming; it must--but there, what a nonsensical notion, thereare no such things as ghosts! Only children and nursemaids believe inthem nowadays. As soon as you have quite recovered, my dears, we will
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][TRANSITION][CONTEXT][METAPHOR][PROBLEM]return to the garden, and I think that under the circumstances, therather peculiar circumstances, ahem! it will be better to say nothingto your mother. Do you understand?[DIALOGUE]" Mr. Whittingen went on, eyeing theservants, "Nothing to your mistress."The affair thus terminated, and for some days nothing further happenedto disturb the peace of the family. At the end of a week, however,
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][DEATH][DANGER][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][METAPHOR]exactly a week after the appearance of the piper, Mary met with aserious accident. She was running across the croquet lawn to speak toher sister-in-law, when she tripped over a hoop that had beenaccidentally left there, and, in falling, ran a hatpin into her head.Blood poisoning ensued, and within a fortnight she was dead. Marthawas the only one in the house, however, who associated Mary's accidentand death with the piper; to her that sinister expression in themysterious Highlander's eyes portended mischief, and she could notbut suspect that, in some way or another, he had brought about thecatastrophe. The autumn waned, and Christmas was well within sight,
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][EMOTION][DANGER][PROBLEM][FLASHBACK][ACTION]when another mysterious occurrence took place. It was early one Sundayevening, tea was just over, and the Whittingen family were sittinground the fire engaged in a somewhat melancholy conversation, for theloss of Mary had affected them all very deeply, when they heard thefar-away rumble of a heavy coach on the high-road. Nearer and nearerit came, till it seemed to be about on a level with the front lodgegate; then to their surprise there was a loud crunching of gravel, andthey heard it careering at a breakneck speed up the carriage-drive.They looked at one another in the utmost consternation.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][DANGER][EMOTION][PROBLEM][HORROR][DIALOGUE]"A coach, and driven in this mad fashion! Whose was it? What did itmean? Not visitors, surely!"It pulled up at the front door, and the champing and stamping of thehorses vibrated loudly through the still night air. Sounds as of oneor more people descending were next heard, and then there came aseries of the most terrific knockings at the door. The Whittingenfamily stared at one another aghast; there was something in thoseknockings--something they could not explain--that struck terror intheir souls and made their blood run cold. They waited in breathlessanxiety for the door to be opened; but no servant went to open it. The
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][HORROR]knocks were repeated, if anything louder than before, the door swungback on its hinges, and the tread of heavy footsteps were heard slowlyapproaching the drawing-room. Mrs. Whittingen gave a low gasp ofhorror, Ruth screamed, Harvey buried his face in his hands, Mr.Whittingen rose to his feet, and made desperate efforts to get to thebell, but could not stir, whilst Martha rushed to the drawing-roomdoor and locked it. They then with one accord began to pray. The stepshalted outside the room, the door slowly opened, and the blurredoutlines of a group of ghastly-looking figures, supporting agrotesquely shaped object in their midst, appeared on the threshold.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][DANGER][FLASHBACK]For some seconds there was a grim silence. It was abruptly broken by athud--Ruth had slipped from her chair to the floor in a dead faint;whereupon the shadowy forms solemnly veered round and made their wayback again to the front door. The latter swung violently open, therewas a rush of icy wind which swept like a hurricane across the halland into the drawing-room, the front door then slammed to with acrash, and the coach drove away.Every one's attention was now directed to Ruth. At first sal-volatile
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]and cold water produced no effect, but after a time she slowly, veryslowly regained consciousness. As soon as she had recoveredsufficiently to speak, she expressed an earnest desire that noreference should ever be made in her presence to what had justhappened. [DIALOGUE]"It was for me!" she said in such an emphatic tone as filledher audience with the direst forebodings. [DIALOGUE]"I know it was for me; theyall looked in my direction. God help me! I shall die like Mary."Though greatly perplexed as to what she meant, for no one exceptingherself had been able to make out the phenomena with any degree ofdistinctness, they yielded to her entreaties, and asked her noquestions. The servants had neither heard nor seen anything. A
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][HAUNTED HOUSE]fortnight later, Ruth was taken ill with appendicitis; peritonitisspeedily set in, and she died under the operation. The Whittingens nowbegan to wish they had never come to Donaldgowerie; but, with theastuteness that had been characteristic of the family throughcountless generations of fair days and foul, they took the greatestprecautions never to drop even as much as a hint to the servants or toany one in the town that the house was haunted.A year passed without any further catastrophe, and they were beginningto hope their ghastly visitors had left them, when something elseoccurred. It was Easter-time, and Ernest, his wife, and baby werestaying with them. The baby, a boy, was fat and bonny, the very
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CONFLICT]picture of health and happiness.Mrs. Whittingen and Martha vied with one another in their devotion tohim; and either one or other of them was always dancing attendance onhim. It so happened that one afternoon, whilst the servants werehaving their tea, Martha found herself alone in the upper part of thehouse with her precious nephew. Mr. Whittingen had gone to Edinburghto consult his lawyer (the head of the firm with whom Harvey wasarticled) on business, whilst Mrs. Whittingen had taken her son anddaughter-in-law for a drive. The weather was glorious, and Martha,
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][TRANSITION]though as little appreciative of the beauties of nature as mostcommercial-minded young women, could not but admire the colouring ofthe sky as she looked out of the nursery window. The sun haddisappeared, but the effect of its rays was still apparent on thewestern horizon, where the heavens were washed with alternate streaksof gold and red and pink--the colour of each streak excessivelybrilliant in the centre, but paling towards the edges. Here and therewere golden, pink-tipped clouds and crimson islets surrounded withseas of softest blue. And outside the limits of this sun-kissed pale,the blue of the sky gradually grew darker and darker, until its linewas altogether lost in the black shadows of night that, creeping overthe lone mountain-tops in the far east, slowly swept forward. Wafted
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][SUSPENSE]by the gentle breeze came the dull moaning and whispering of the pinetrees, the humming of the wind through the telephone wires, and thediscordant cawing of the crows. And it seemed to Martha, as she satthere and peered out into the garden, that over the whole atmosphereof the place had come a subtle and hostile change--a change in thenoises of the trees, the birds, the wind; a change in theflower-scented ether; a change, a most marked and emphatic change, inthe shadows. What was it? What was this change? Whence did it
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][TRANSITION]originate? What did it portend? A slight noise, a most trivial noise,attracted Martha's attention to the room; she looked round and wasquite startled to see how dark it had grown. In the old days, when shehad scoffed at ghosts, she would as soon have been in the dark as inthe light, the night had no terrors for her; but now--now since thoseawful occurrences last year, all was different, and as she peeredapprehensively about her, her flesh crawled. What was there in that
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][CONFLICT]corner opposite, that corner hemmed in on the one side by thecupboard--how she hated cupboards, particularly when they had shinysurfaces on which were reflected all sorts of curious things--and thechest of drawers on the other. It was a shadow, only a shadow, but ofwhat? She searched the room everywhere to find its materialcounterpart, and at last discovered it in the nurse's shawl which hungover the back of a chair. Then she laughed, and would have gone onlaughing, for she tried to persuade herself that laughter banishedghosts, when suddenly something else caught her eyes. What was it? An
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE][EMOTION][METAPHOR][WEAPON][PROBLEM][PERSPECTIVE][HORROR]object that glittered evilly like two eyes. She got up in a state ofthe most hideous fascination and walked towards it. Then she laughedagain--it was a pair of scissors. The nurse's scissors--clean, bright,and sharp. Why did she pick them up and feel the blades so caressingly
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][DANGER][TRANSITION][SUSPENSE][HORROR]with her thumb? Why did she glance from them to the baby? Why? In thename of God, why? Frightful ideas laid hold of her mind. She tried to
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][ACTION][WEAPON][DANGER]chase them away but they quickly returned. The scissors, why were theyin her fingers? Why could not she put them down? For what were theyintended? Cutting! cutting thread, and tape,--and throats! Throats!
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][EMOTION][METAPHOR][DANGER][SUSPENSE][HORROR]And she giggled hysterically at the bare notion. But what was thisround her waist--this shadowy arm-like object! She looked fearfullyround, and her soul died within her as she encountered themalevolent, gleeful eyes of the sinister piper, pressed closelyagainst her face. Was it she he wanted this time--she, or--or whom--inthe name of all that was pitiable?
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][CONFLICT]Desperately, as if all the lives in the universe and the future of hersoul were at stake, did she struggle to free herself from hisgrasp--but in vain; every fibre, every muscle of her body wascompletely at his will. On and on he pushed her, until foot by foot,inch by inch, she approached the cradle, and all the while his hellishvoice was breathing the vilest of inspirations into her brain. At lastshe stood by the side of the baby, and bent over it. What a darling!
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CHARACTER][EMOTION]What a dear! What a duck! A sweet, pretty, innocent, prattling duck!How like her mother--how like her handsome brother--how likeherself--very, very like herself! How every one loved it--how every
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][PERSPECTIVE][CHARACTER][METAPHOR][EXPOSITION][SURPRISE][CHARACTERIZATION]one worshipped it--how (and here the grey face beside her chuckled)every one would miss it! How pink its toes--how fat its calves--howchubby its little palms--how bonny its cheeks--and how white, howgloriously, heavenly, snowy white--its throat! And she stretchedforth one of her stubby, inartistic fingers and played with its flesh.Then she glanced furtively at the scissors, and smiled.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CLIMAX][CONFLICT][MURDER]It was soon done, soon over, and she and the grey-faced piper danced aminuet in the moonbeams; afterwards he piped a farewell dirge,--awild, weird, funereal dirge, and, marching slowly backwards, his dark,gleaming eyes fixed gloatingly on hers, disappeared through thewindow. Then the reaction set in, and Martha raved and shrieked tillevery one in the house flew to the rescue.Of course, no one--saving her father and mother--believed her. Ernest,his wife, and the servants attributed her bloody act to jealousy; thelaw--to madness; and she subsequently journeyed from Donaldgowerie toa criminal lunatic asylum, where the recollection of all she had donesoon killed her. This was the climax. Mr. Whittingen sold
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE][GHOST]Donaldgowerie, and a new house was shortly afterwards erected in itsstead.                        CASE XIII    THE FLOATING HEAD OF THE BENRACHETT INN,      NEAR THE PERTH ROAD, DUNDEESome years ago, when I was engaged in collecting cases for a book Icontemplated publishing, on _Haunted Houses in England and Wales_, Iwas introduced to an Irish clergyman, whose name I have forgotten, andwhom I have never met since. Had the incident he related taken placein England or Wales, I should have noted it down carefully, but as itoccurred in Scotland (and I had no intention then of bringing out avolume on Scottish phantasms), I did not do so.My memory, however, I can assure my readers, in spite of the manyghost tales committed to it,--for scarcely a day passes that I do nothear one,--seldom fails, and the Irish clergyman's story, which I amabout to relate, comes back to me now with startling vividness.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]One summer evening, early in the eighties, Mr. Murphy--the name bywhich I will designate the originator of this story--and his wifearrived in Dundee. The town was utterly unknown to them, and they weretouring Scotland for the first time. Not knowing where to put up forthe night, and knowing no one to whom they could apply forinformation, they consulted a local paper, and from the long list ofhotels and boarding-houses advertised therein selected the BenrachettInn, near the Perth Road, as being the one most likely to meet theirmodest requirements. They were certainly not disappointed with theexterior of the hotel they had chosen, for as soon as they saw it theyexclaimed simultaneously, [DIALOGUE]"What a delightful old place!" And old itcertainly was, for the many-gabled, oaken structure and projectingwindows unquestionably indicated the sixteenth century, whilst, toenhance the effect and give it a true touch in detail of [DIALOGUE]"ye ancienttimes," a huge antique lantern was hung over the entrance. Nor did the
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE]interior impress them less favourably. The rooms were large, and low,the ceilings, walls, floors, and staircase all of oak. Thediamond-lattice windows, and narrow, tortuous passages, andinnumerable nooks and crannies and cupboards, created an atmosphere ofcombined quaintness and comfort that irresistibly appealed to theMurphys. Viewed under the searching rays of the sun, and cheered bythe voices of the visitors, the interior of the house, for artistictaste and cheerfulness, would indeed be hard to beat; but, as Mrs.Murphy's eyes wandered up the stairs and down the corridors, she wasfilled with misgivings as to how the place would strike her at night.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]Though not nervous naturally, and by no means superstitious, at night,when the house was dark and silent, and the moon called forth theshadows, she was not without that feeling of uneasiness which mostpeople--even avowed sceptics, experience when passing the night instrange and novel quarters.The room they engaged--I cannot say selected, as, the hotel beingfull, they had [DIALOGUE]"Hobson's choice"--was at the end of a very longpassage, at the back of the house, and overlooking the yard. It was alarge apartment, and in one of its several recesses stood the bed, agigantic, ebony four-poster, with spotlessly clean valance, and, whatwas of even greater importance, well-aired sheets. The other furniturein the room, being of the same sort as that in the majority ofold-fashioned hostels, needs no description; but a fixture in theshape of a cupboard, a deep, dark cupboard, let into the wall facingthe bed, instantly attracted Mrs. Murphy's attention. There is always
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE]something interesting in cupboards, particularly old and roomycupboards, when it is night-time and one is about to get into bed. Itis then that they suggest all manner of fascinating possibilities.It was to this cupboard, then, that Mrs. Murphy paid the greatestattention, before commencing to undress prior to getting into bed. Shepoked about in it for some moments, and then, apparently satisfiedthat no one was hidden there, continued her investigation of the room.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CONFLICT]Mr. Murphy did not assist--he pleaded fatigue, and sat on the cornerof the bed munching a gingerbread and reading the _Dundee Advertiser_till the operation was over. He then helped Mrs. Murphy unpack theirportmanteau, and, during the process, whiled away so much time inconversation, that they were both startled when a clock from someadjacent church solemnly boomed twelve. They were then seized withsomething approaching a panic, and hastened to disrobe.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][DIALOGUE]"I wish we had a night-light, John," Mrs. Murphy said, as she got upfrom her prayers. [DIALOGUE]"I suppose it wouldn't do to keep one of the candlesburning. I am not exactly afraid, only I don't fancy being left in thedark. I had a curious sensation when I was in the cupboard just now--Ican't exactly explain it--but I feel now that I would like the lightleft burning."[DIALOGUE]"It certainly is rather a gloomy room," Mr. Murphy remarked, raisinghis eyes to the black oak ceiling, and then allowing them to dwell inturn on each of the angles and recesses. [DIALOGUE]"And I agree with you itwould be nice if we had a night-light, or, better still, gas. But aswe haven't, my dear, and we shall be on our feet a good dealto-morrow, I think we ought to try and get to sleep as soon aspossible."He blew out the candle as he spoke, and quickly scrambled into bed. Along hush followed, broken only by the sound of breathing, and anoccasional ticking as of some long-legged creature on the wall andwindow-blind. Mrs. Murphy could never remember if she actually went to
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][HORROR]sleep, but she is sure her husband did, as she distinctly heard himsnore--and the sound, so detestable to her as a rule, was so welcometo her then. She was lying listening to it, and wishing with all hersoul she could get to sleep, when she suddenly became aware of asmell--a most offensive, pungent odour, that blew across the room andcrept up her nostrils. The cold perspiration of fear at once broke outon her forehead. Nasty as the smell was, it suggested something morehorrible, something she dared not attempt to analyse. She thought
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]several times of rousing her husband, but, remembering how tired hehad been, she desisted, and, with all her faculties abnormally on thealert, she lay awake and listened. A deathlike hush hung over thehouse, interrupted at intervals by the surreptitious noises peculiarto the night--enigmatical creaks and footsteps, rustlings as ofdrapery, sighs and whisperings--all very faint, all very subtle, andall possibly, just possibly, attributable to natural causes. Mrs.Murphy caught herself--why, she could not say--waiting for somedefinite auditory manifestation of what she instinctively felt wasnear at hand. At present, however, she could not locate it, she couldonly speculate on its whereabouts--it was somewhere in the directionof the cupboard. And each time the stench came to her, the conviction
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][SURPRISE][CONFLICT]that its origin was in the cupboard grew. At last, unable to sustainthe suspense any longer, and urged on by an irresistible fascination,she got softly out of bed, and, creeping stealthily forward, found herway with surprisingly little difficulty (considering it was pitch darkand the room was unfamiliar to her) to the cupboard.With every step she took the stink increased, and by the time she hadreached the cupboard she was almost suffocated. For some seconds shetoyed irresolutely with the door handle, longing to be back again inbed, but unable to tear herself away from the cupboard. At last,
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE]yielding to the demands of some pitilessly exacting unknown influence,she held her breath and swung open the door. The moment she did so theroom filled with the faint, phosphorescent glow of decay, and shesaw, exactly opposite her, a head--a human head--floating in mid-air.Petrified with terror, she lost every atom of strength, and, entirelybereft of the power to move or articulate a sound, she stoodstock-still staring at it. That it was the head of a man, she couldonly guess from the matted crop of short red hair that fell in adisordered entanglement over the upper part of the forehead and ears.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][HORROR]All else was lost in a loathsome, disgusting mass of detestabledecomposition, too utterly vile and foul to describe. On the abnormalthing beginning to move forward, the spell that bound Mrs. Murphy tothe floor was broken, and, with a cry of horror, she fled to the bedand awoke her husband.The head was by this time close to them, and had not Mrs. Murphydragged her husband forcibly out of its way, it would have touchedhim.His terror was even greater than hers; but for the moment neithercould speak. They stood clutching one another in an awful silence.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]Mrs. Murphy at length gasped out, [DIALOGUE]"Pray, John, pray! Command the thingin the name of God to depart." Mr. Murphy made a desperate effort todo so, but not a syllable would come. The head now veered round andwas moving swiftly towards them, its awful stench causing them both toretch and vomit. Mr. Murphy, seizing his stick, lashed at it with allhis might. The result was one they might well have expected. The stick
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][PROBLEM]met with no resistance, and the head continued to advance. Both Mr.and Mrs. Murphy then made a frantic attempt to find the door, the headstill pursuing them, and, tripping over something in their wild haste,fell together on the floor. There was now no hope, the head had caughtthem up; it hovered immediately above them, and, descending lower,lower, and lower, finally passed right through them, through thefloor, and out of sight. It was long ere either of them couldsufficiently recover to stir from the floor, and when they did move,it was only to totter to their bed, and to lie with the bedclotheswell over their heads, quivering and quaking till the morning.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]The hot morning sun dissipating their fears, they got up, and,hurrying downstairs, demanded an interview with their landlord. It wasin vain the latter argued it was all a nightmare they showed theabsurdity of such a theory by vehemently attesting they had bothsimultaneously experienced the phenomena. They were about to taketheir departure, when the landlord, retracting all he had said,offered them another room and any terms they liked, [DIALOGUE]"if only theywould stay and hold their tongues."[DIALOGUE]"I know every word of what you say is true," he said, in suchsubmissive tones that the tender hearts of Mr. and Mrs. Murphyinstantly relented, and they promised to remain. "But what am I to do?
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][DANGER][HAUNTED HOUSE]I cannot shut up a house which I have taken on a twenty years' lease,because one room in it is haunted--and, after all, there is only onevisitor in twenty who is disturbed by the apparition. What is thehistory of the head? Why, it is said to be that of a pedlar who wasmurdered here over a hundred years ago. The body was hidden behind thewainscoting, and his head under the cupboard floor. The miscreants
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CONTEXT][EMOTION][CHARACTERIZATION][HAUNTED HOUSE]were never caught; they are supposed to have gone down in a ship thatsailed from this port just about that time and was never heard ofagain.[DIALOGUE]"This is the gist of the story the clergyman told me, and, believingit as I undoubtedly do to be true, there is every reason to supposethat the inn, to which I have, of course, given a fictitious name, ifstill in existence, is still haunted.                         CASE XIV    THE HAUNTINGS OF "---- HOUSE," IN THE      NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE GREAT WESTERN ROAD,      ABERDEENThe following experience of a haunting is that of Mr. Scarfe, who toldit me some few summers ago, expressing at the same time greateagerness to accompany me on some of my investigations.I append it as nearly as possible in his own words:--I was spending Easter, he began, with some friends of mine inAberdeen, and, learning from them that there was a haunted house inthe immediate vicinity of the Great Western Road, I begged them to tryand get me permission to spend a night in it. As good luck would have
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][DANGER][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][ACTION]it, the landlord happened to be a connection of theirs, and althoughat first rather reluctant to give me leave, lest by doing so heshould create a precedent, and, consequently, be pestered to death bypeople whom he knew to be as anxious as I was to see the ghost, heeventually yielded; and, the following evening at 8 p.m., accompaniedonly by my dog, Scott, I entered the premises.I cannot say I felt very comfortable when the door slammed behind me,and I found myself standing alone in a cold, dark passage out of whichrose a gloomy staircase, suggestive of all sorts of uncannypossibilities. However, overcoming these nervous apprehensions as best
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]I could, I began a thorough search of the premises, to make sure thatno one was hiding there.Descending first of all into the basement, I explored the kitchen,scullery, larder, and other domestic offices. The place fairly reekedwith damp, but this was not to be wondered at, taking in considerationthe fact, that the soil was clay, the floor of the very poorestquality of cement, cracked and broken in a dozen and one places, andthat there had been no fires in any of the rooms for many months. Hereand there in the darkest corners were clusters of ugly cockroaches,whilst more than one monstrous rat scampered away on my approach. My
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE]dog, or rather the dog that was lent me, and which went by the name ofScott, kept close at my heel, showing no very great enthusiasm in hismission, and giving even the rodents as wide a berth as possible.I invariably trust to my psychic faculty (as you know, Mr. O'Donnell,some people are born with the faculty) to enable me to detect thepresence of the superphysical. I generally feel the latterincorporated in some inexplicable manner in the ether, or see itinextricably interwoven with the shadows.Here in the basement it was everywhere--the air was simply saturatedwith it, and, as the fading sunlight called shadow after shadow intoexistence, it confronted me enigmatically whichever way I turned.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]I went upstairs, and the presence followed me. In one or two of thetop bedrooms--more particularly in a tiny garret overlooking theback-yard--the Presence seemed inclined to hover. For some seconds Iwaited there, in order to see if there would be any furtherdevelopment; there being none--I obeyed the mandates of a suddenimpulse and made my way once more to the basement. On arriving at thetop of the kitchen stairs, Scott showed a decided disinclination todescend farther. Crouching down, he whined piteously, and when I
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][DANGER][PROBLEM][MONSTER]attempted to grasp him by the collar, snarled in a most savage manner.Consequently, thinking it better to have no companion at all than oneso unwilling, I descended without him.The stairs terminated in a very dark and narrow passage, into whichthe doors of the kitchen, larder, store room, etc., openedrespectively, and at the farther extremity of which was a doorwayleading to the back-yard. The superphysical Presence seeming to be
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]more pronounced in this passage than anywhere else, I decided to spendthe night in it, and, selecting a spot opposite the entrance to thescullery, I constructed a seat out of two of the drawers of thekitchen dresser, by placing them, one on the other, bottom uppermoston the floor.It was now half-past nine; the traffic in the street overhead wasbeginning to diminish--the rumbling of drays or heavy four-wheelershad almost ceased, whilst the jingling of hansoms and even thepiercing hoot-hoot and loud birr-birr of motors was fast becoming lessand less frequent. I put out my candle and waited; and, as I waited,the hush and gloom of the house deepened and intensified, until, bymidnight, all round me was black and silent--black with a blacknessthat defies penetration, and silent with a silence that challengesonly the rivalry of the grave. Occasionally I heard sounds--such, forexample, as the creaking of a board, the flopping of a cockroach, andthe growling of Scott--sounds which in the daytime would have been tootrivial to attract attention, but which now assumed the most startlingand exaggerated proportions. From time to time I felt my pulse and
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][HAUNTED HOUSE]took my temperature to make sure that I was perfectly normal, whilstat one o'clock, the hour when human vitality begins to be on the wane,I ate some chicken and ham sandwiches, which I helped down with asingle glass of oatmeal stout. So far, beyond my feeling that therewas a superphysical something in the house, nothing had occurred.There had not been the slightest attempt at manifestation, and, as theminutes sped swiftly by I began to fear that, perhaps, after all thehauntings were only of a negative nature. As the clock struck two,however, Scott gave an extra savage snarl, and the next moment cameracing downstairs. Darting along the passage and tearing towards me,
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][METAPHOR][SURPRISE]he scrambled up the overturned drawers, and, burying his face in mylap, set up the most piteous whinings. A sensation of icy coldness,such as could not have been due to any physical cause, now surgedthrough me; and, as I got out my pocket flashlight ready foremergencies, I heard an unmistakable rustling in the cellar opposite.At once my whole attention became riveted in the direction of thissound, and, as I sat gazing fixedly in front of me, the darkness wassuddenly dissipated and the whole passage, from one end to the other,was illuminated by a phosphorescent glow; which glow I can bestdescribe as bearing a close resemblance, in kind though not in degree,to the glow of a glow-worm. I then saw the scullery door slowly beginto open. A hideous fear seized me. What--what in the name of Heaven
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SUSPENSE][EMOTION][SURPRISE][HORROR]should I see? Transfixed with terror, unable to move or utter asound, I crouched against the wall paralysed, helpless; whilst thedoor opened wider and wider.At last, at last after an interval which to me was eternity,Something, an as yet indefinite shadowy Something, loomed in thebackground of the enlargening space. My suspense was now sublime, andI felt that another second or so of such tension would assuredly seeme swoon.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION]The shadowy Something, however, quickly developed, and, in less timethan it takes to write, it assumed the form of a woman--a middle-agedwoman with a startlingly white face, straight nose, and curiouslylined mouth, the two front upper teeth of which projected considerablyand were very long. Her hair was black, her hands coarse, and red, andshe was clad in the orthodox shabby print of a general servant in somemiddle-class family. The expression in her wide-open, glassy blue eyesas they glared into mine was one of such intense mental and physicalagony that I felt every atom of blood in my veins congeal. Creepingstealthily forward, her gaze still on me, she emerged from thedoorway, and motioning to me to follow, glided up the staircase. Up,
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][RELIEF][EMOTION]up, we went, the cold, grey dawn greeting us on our way. Entering thegarret to which I have already alluded, the phantasm noiselesslyapproached the hearth, and, pointing downward with a violent motion ofthe index finger of its right hand, suddenly vanished. A great feelingof relief now came over me, and, yielding to a reaction which was theinevitable consequence of such a severe nervous strain, I reeledagainst the window-sill and shook with laughter.Equanimity at length reasserting itself, I carefully marked the spoton the floor, indicated by the apparition, and descending into thebasement to fetch Scott, made hurried tracks to my friends' house,where I was allowed to sleep on till late in the day. I then returned
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][DANGER][EMOTION][SETTING][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][CHARACTER][CONFLICT][PERSPECTIVE][CONTEXT]to the haunted house with the landlord, and my friend, and, on raisingthe boarding in the garret, we discovered a stamped and addressedenvelope.As the result of our combined inquiries, we learned that a few yearspreviously the house had been occupied by some tradespeople of thename of Piblington, who, some six or seven months before they leftthe house, had had in their employment a servant named Anna Webb.This servant, the description of whose person corresponded in everyway with the ghost I had seen, had been suspected of stealing a lettercontaining money, and had hanged herself in the cellar.The letter, I gathered, with several others, had been given to Anna topost by Mrs. Piblington, and as no reply to the one containing moneywas received, Anna was closely questioned. Naturally nervous and
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][MURDER]highly strung, the inquisition confused her terribly, and herembarrassment being construed into guilt, she was threatened withprosecution. [DIALOGUE]"As a proof of my innocence," she scribbled on a piece ofpaper, which was produced at the subsequent inquest, [DIALOGUE]"I am going tohang myself. I never stole your letter, and can only suppose it waslost in the post."The mere fact of the accused committing suicide would, in manypeople's opinion, point to guilt; and as the postal order was nevertraced, it was generally concluded that Anna had secreted it, and hadbeen only waiting till inquiries ceased, and the affair was forgotten,to cash it. Of course, the letter I found was the missing one, andalthough apparently hidden with intent, the fact of its never havingbeen opened seemed to suggest that Anna was innocent, and that theenvelope had, by some extraordinary accident, fallen unnoticed by Annathrough the crack between the boards. Anyhow, its discovery put an endto the disturbances and the apparition of the unfortunatesuicide--whether guilty or innocent, and the Judgment Day can alonedetermine that--has never been seen since.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][GHOST]                         CASE XV    THE WHITE LADY OF ROWNAM AVENUE, NEAR      STIRLINGLike most European countries, Scotland claims its share of phantasmsin the form of [DIALOGUE]"White Ladies." According to Mr. Ingram, in his_Haunted Houses and Family Legends_, the ruins of the mansion ofWoodhouselee are haunted by a woman in white, presumably (though,personally, I think otherwise) the ghost of Lady Hamilton ofBothwellhaugh. This unfortunate lady, together with her baby,was--during the temporary absence of her husband--stripped naked andturned out of doors on a bitterly cold night, by a favourite of theRegent Murray. As a result of this inhuman conduct the child died, andits mother, with the corpse in her arms, was discovered in the morningraving mad. Another instance of this particular form of apparition isto be found in Sir Walter Scott's [DIALOGUE]"White Lady of Avenel," and thereare endless others, both in reality and fiction.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][FLASHBACK][CONTEXT][GHOST]Some years ago, when I was putting up at a friend's house inEdinburgh, I was introduced to a man who had had several experienceswith ghosts, and had, therefore, been especially asked to meet me.After we had talked together for some time, he related the followingadventure which had befallen him, in his childhood, in Rownam avenue(the seat of Sir E.C.), near Stirling:--I was always a lover of nature, he began, and my earliestreminiscences are associated with solitary rambles through the fields,dells, and copses surrounding my home. I lived within a stone's-throw
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][RELIEF][CHARACTER][CONFLICT][PERSPECTIVE][SURPRISE][HORROR]of the property of old Sir E.C., who has long gone to rest--God blesshis soul! And I think it needs blessing, for if there was any truth inlocal gossip (and it is said, I think truly, that [DIALOGUE]"There is never anysmoke without fire") he had lived a very queer life. Indeed, he was
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][RELIEF]held in such universal awe and abhorrence that we used to fly at hisapproach, and never spoke of him amongst ourselves saving in suchterms as [DIALOGUE]"Auld dour crab," or [DIALOGUE]"The laird deil."Rownam Manor House, where he lived, was a fine specimen ofsixteenth-century architecture, and had it been called a castle wouldhave merited the appellation far more than many of the buildings inScotland that bear that name. It was approached by a long avenue oftrees--gigantic elms, oaks, and beeches, that, uniting their branchesoverhead in summertime, formed an effectual barrier to the sun's rays.This avenue had an irresistible attraction for me. It literallyswarmed with rabbits and squirrels, and many are the times I havetrespassed there to watch them. I had a very secure hiding-place in
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CONFLICT][DANGER]the hollow of an old oak, where I have often been secreted while SirE.C. and his keepers, without casting a glance in my direction, passedunsuspectingly by, vowing all sorts of vengeance against trespassers.Of course, I had to be very careful how I got there, for the groundswere well patrolled, and Sir E.C. had sworn to prosecute anyone he
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][DANGER][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][CONTEXT][EXPOSITION][METAPHOR]caught walking in them without his permission. Had Sir E.C. caught me,I should, doubtless, have been treated with the utmost severity, sincehe and my father were the most bitter opponents politically, and forthat reason, unreasonable though it be, never lost an opportunity ofinsulting one another. My father, a strong Radical, was opposed to all
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]big landed proprietors, and consequently winked his eye at mytrespassings; but I think nothing would really have pleased him betterthan to have seen me brought to book by Sir E.C., since in my defencehe would have had an opportunity of appealing to the passions of thelocal people, who were all Radicals, and of incensing them stillfurther against the principles of feudalism.But to continue. I had often heard it rumoured in the village that
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][DEATH][SUSPENSE][METAPHOR][PROBLEM][CHARACTERIZATION][HAUNTED HOUSE]Rownam avenue was haunted, and that the apparition was a lady inwhite, and no other than Sir E.C.'s wife, whose death at a very earlyage had been hastened, if not entirely accounted for, by her husband'sharsh treatment. Whether Sir E.C. was really as black as he was
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][HAUNTED HOUSE]painted I have never been able to ascertain; the intense animositywith which we all regarded him, made us believe anything ill of him,and we were quite ready to attribute all the alleged hauntings in theneighbourhood to his past misdeeds. I believe my family, with scarcelyan exception, believed in ghosts; anyhow, the subject of ghosts wasso often discussed in my hearing that I became possessed of anungovernable curiosity to see one. If only [DIALOGUE]"The White Lady" wouldappear in the daytime, I thought, I should have no difficulty insatisfying this curiosity, but unfortunately she did not appear tillnight--in fact, not until long after boys of my age had beenruthlessly ordered off to bed. I did not quite like the idea ofstealing out of the house at dead of night and going alone to see theghost, so I suggested to my schoolfellow that he should also breakloose one night and accompany me to Rownam to see [DIALOGUE]"The White Lady." Itwas, however, of no use. Much as he would have liked to have seen a
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]ghost in broad daylight, it was quite another matter at night, to saynothing of running the risk of being caught trespassing by thatinveterate enemy, Sir E.C. At length, finding that neither persuasion,bribery, nor taunts of cowardice had any effect on my schoolfellow,who could not decide which appearance would be the more appalling,for,--he assured me I should be certain to encounter either one or theother--the White Lady, or the Laird Deil,--I gave up all furthereffort to induce him to accompany me, and made up my mind to go toRownam avenue alone.Biding my opportunity, and waiting till my father was safely out ofthe way,--on a visit to Greenock, where some business transactionwould oblige him to remain for some days,--I climbed out of my bedroomwindow, when I deemed the rest of the household to be sound asleep,scudded swiftly across the fields, and, making short work of the loftywall that formed the southernmost boundary of the Rownam estates,quickly made my way to the avenue. It was an ideal Sunday night in
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]August, and it seemed as if all nature participated in the Sabbathabstraction from noise and work. Hardly a sound broke the exquisitesilence of the woods. At times, overcome with the delightful sensationof freedom, I paused, and, raising my eyes to the starry heavens,drank in huge draughts of the pure country air, tainted only with thesweet smell of newly mown hay, and the scent of summer flowers. Ibecame intoxicated, delirious, and in transports of joy threw myselfon the soft mossy ground, and, baring my throat and chest, bathedmyself in the moonbeams' kisses. Then, picking myself slowly up, I
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]performed the maddest capers, and, finally sobering down, continued mycourse. Every now and again fancying I detected the stealthy footstepsof a keeper, I hid behind a tree, where I remained till I was quiteassured I had been mistaken, and that no one was about. How long Idallied I do not know, but it must have been fully one o'clock beforeI arrived at the outskirts of the avenue, and, advancing eagerly,ensconced myself in my favourite sanctuary, the hollow oak. All washushed and motionless, and, as I gazed into the gloom, I becameconscious, for the first time in my life, of a sensation of eeriness.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION]The arched canopy of foliage overhead was strongly suggestive of afuneral pall; not a glimmer of moonlight penetrated through it; andall beneath seemed to me to be buried in the silence and blackness ofthe grave.The loneliness got on my nerves; at first I grew afraid, only afraid,and then my fears turned into a panic, a wild, mad panic, consistingin the one desire to get where there were human beings--creatures Iknew and understood. With this end in view I emerged from my retreat,and was preparing to fly through the wood, when, from afar off, theresuddenly came the sound of a voice, the harsh, grating voice of a man.Convinced this time that I had been discovered by a keeper, I jumpedback into the tree, and, swarming up the inside of the trunk, peepedcautiously out. What I saw nearly made me jump out of my skin.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][SURPRISE][GHOST]Advancing along the avenue was the thing I had always longed to see,and for which I had risked so much: the mysterious, far-famed [DIALOGUE]"Lady inWhite,"--a ghost, an actual, _bona fide_ ghost! How every nerve in mybody thrilled with excitement, and my heart thumped--till it seemed onthe verge of bursting through my ribs! [DIALOGUE]"The Lady in White!" Why, itwould be the talk of the whole countryside! Some one had _really_--nohearsay evidence--seen the notorious apparition at last. How all my
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE]schoolfellows would envy me, and how bitterly they would chidethemselves for being too cowardly to accompany me! I looked at herclosely, and noticed that she was entirely luminous, emitting a strongphosphorescent glow like the glow of a glow-worm, saving that it wasin a perpetual state of motion. She wore a quantity of white draperyswathed round her in a manner that perplexed me sorely, until Isuddenly realised with a creeping of my flesh that it must be awinding-sheet, that burial accessary so often minutely described to meby the son of the village undertaker. Though interesting, I did notthink it at all becoming, and would have preferred to see any otherstyle of garment. Streaming over her neck and shoulders were thick
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]masses of long, wavy, golden hair, which was ruffled, but onlyslightly ruffled, by the gentle summer breeze. Her face, thoughterrifying by reason of its unearthly pallor, was so beautiful, that,had not some restraining influence compelled me to remain in hiding, Iwould have descended from my perch to obtain a nearer view of it.Indeed, I only once caught a glimpse of her full face, for, with apersistence that was most annoying, she kept it turned from me; but inthat brief second the lustre of her long, blue eyes won my very soul,and boy as I was I felt, like the hero in song, that I would, for mybonnie ghost, in very deed, [DIALOGUE]"lay me doon and dee."Her eyes are still firmly impressed on my memory; I shall neverforget them, any more than I shall forget the dainty curves of herfull red lips and the snowy whiteness of her perfect teeth. Nothing, Ithought, either on earth or in heaven could have been half so lovely,and I was so enraptured that it was not until she was directly beneathme that I perceived she was not alone, that walking by her side, withone arm round her waist, his face and figure illuminated with thelight from her body, was Sir E.C. But how changed! Gone were the deep
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][TRANSITION][EMOTION]black scowl, the savage tightening of the jaws, and the intenselydisagreeable expression that had earned for him the nickname of [DIALOGUE]"Thelaird deil," and in their stead I saw _love_--nothing but blind,infatuated, soul-devouring _love_--love for which no words can find anadequate description.Throwing discretion to the wind--for my excitement and curiosity hadrisen to the highest pitch--I now thrust more than half my body out ofthe hole in the trunk. The next instant, with a cry of dismay, Ipitched head first on to the ground.It would seem that boys, like cats, cannot in ordinary circumstancesbe killed, and, instead of breaking my neck, I merely suffered thatmost immaterial injury--immaterial, at least, in my case--a temporarydisendowment of the senses. On regaining the few wits I could lay
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]claim to, I fully expected to find myself in the hands of the iratelaird, who would seize me by the scruff of the neck and belabour me topieces. Consequently, too frightened to move, I lay absolutely stillwith my eyes shut. But as the minutes glided by and nothing happened,I picked myself up. All was quiet and pitch dark--not a vestige of the[DIALOGUE]"Lady in White"--not a vestige of Sir E.C.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][ACTION][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][DANGER][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][HORROR]It did not take me very long to get out of the wood and home. I ranall the way, and as it was still early--far too early for any of thehousehold to be astir, I crept up to my bedroom unobserved. But not tosleep, oh dear me, no! not to sleep, for the moment I blew the candleout and got into bed, reaction set in, and I suffered agonies of fear!
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][DEATH][PROBLEM][DANGER]When I went to school in the morning, my equilibrium restored, and,bubbling over with excitement to tell the boys what had happened, Ireceived another shock--before I could ejaculate a word of myexperiences, I was told--told with a roar and shout that almost brokethe drum of my ears, that [DIALOGUE]"the auld laird deil" was dead! His body hadbeen found stretched on the ground, a few feet from the hollow oak, inthe avenue shortly after sunrise. He had died from syncope, so thedoctor said, that had probably been caused by a shock--some severemental shock.I did not tell my companions of my night's adventure after all. My
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][DEATH]eagerness to do so had departed when I heard of [DIALOGUE]"the auld laird's"death.                         CASE XVI    THE GHOST OF THE HINDOO CHILD, OR THE      HAUNTINGS OF THE WHITE DOVE HOTEL, NEAR      ST. SWITHIN'S STREET, ABERDEENIn the course of many years' investigation of haunted houses, I havenaturally come in contact with numerous people who have had first-handexperiences with the Occult. Nurse Mackenzie is one of these people. I
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]met her for the first time last year at the house of my old friend,Colonel Malcolmson, whose wife she was nursing.For some days I was hardly aware she was in the house, the illness ofher patient keeping her in constant seclusion, but when Mrs.Malcolmson grew better, I not infrequently saw her, taking a morning[DIALOGUE]"constitutional" in the beautiful castle grounds. It was on one ofthese occasions that she favoured me with an account of her psychicaladventure.It happened, she began, shortly after I had finished my term asprobationer at St. K.'s Hospital, Edinburgh. A letter was received at
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][DANGER][ACTION][SURPRISE][PROBLEM]the hospital one morning with the urgent request that two nursesshould be sent to a serious case near St. Swithin's Street. As theletter was signed by a well-known physician in the town, it receivedimmediate attention, and Nurse Emmett and I were dispatched, as dayand night nurses respectively, to the scene of action. My hours onduty were from 9 p.m. till 9 a.m. The house in which the patient was
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]located was the White Dove Hotel, a thoroughly respectable andwell-managed establishment. The proprietor knew nothing about theinvalid, except that her name was Vining, and that she had, at oneperiod of her career, been an actress. He had noticed that she hadlooked ill on her arrival the previous week. Two days after herarrival, she had complained of feeling very ill, and the doctor, whohad been summoned to attend her, said that she was suffering from avery loathsome Oriental disease, which, fortunately is, in thiscountry, rare. The hotel, though newly decorated and equipped
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]throughout with every up-to-date convenience, was in reality veryold. It was one of those delightfully roomy erections that seem builtfor eternity rather than time, and for comfort rather than economy ofspace. The interior, with its oak-panelled walls, polished oak floors,and low ceilings, traversed with ponderous oaken beams, also impressedme pleasantly, whilst a flight of broad, oak stairs, fenced withbalustrades a foot thick, brought me to a seemingly interminablecorridor, into which the door of Miss Vining's room opened. It was alow, wainscoted apartment, and its deep-set window, revealing thethickness of the wall, looked out upon a dismal yard littered withbrooms and buckets. Opposite the foot of the bed--a modern French
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][EMOTION][DANGER]bedstead, by the bye, whose brass fittings and somewhat flimsyhangings were strangely incongruous with their venerablesurroundings--was an ingle, containing the smouldering relics of whathad doubtless been intended for a fire, but which needed considerablecoaxing before it could be converted from a pretence to a reality.There was no exit save by the doorway I had entered, and no furnituresave a couple of rush-bottomed chairs and a table strewn with anuntidy medley of writing materials and medicine bottles.A feeling of depression, contrasting strangely with the effectproduced on me by the cheerfulness of the hotel in general, seized medirectly I entered the room. Despite the brilliancy of the electriclight and the new and gaudy bed-hangings, the air was full of gloom--agloom which, for the very reason that it was unaccountable, was themore alarming. I felt it hanging around me like the undeveloped shadow
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]of something singularly hideous and repulsive, and, on my approachingthe sick woman, it seemed to thrust itself in my way and force meback.Miss Vining was decidedly good-looking; she had the typicallytheatrical features--neatly moulded nose and chin, curly yellow hair,and big, dreamy blue eyes that especially appeal to a certain class ofmen; like most women, however, I prefer something more solid, bothphysically and intellectually--I cannot stand [DIALOGUE]"the pretty, pretty."She was, of course, far too ill to converse, and, beyond a fewdesultory and spasmodic ejaculations, maintained a rigid silence. Asthere was no occasion for me to sit close beside her, I drew up achair before the fire, placing myself in such a position as to commanda full view of the bed. My first night passed undisturbed by anyincident, and in the morning the condition of my patient showed aslight improvement. It was eight o'clock in the evening when I came on
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][EMOTION]duty again, and, the weather having changed during the day, the wholeroom echoed and re-echoed with the howling of the wind, which wasraging round the house with demoniacal fury.I had been at my post for a little over two hours--and had justregistered my patient's temperature, when, happening to look up fromthe book I was reading, I saw to my surprise that the chair beside thehead of the bed was occupied by a child--a tiny girl. How she had comeinto the room without attracting my attention was certainlyextraordinary, and I could only suppose that the shrieking of the winddown the wide chimney had deadened the sound of the door and herfootsteps.I was naturally, of course, very indignant that she had dared to comein without rapping, and, getting up from my seat I was preparing toaddress her and bid her go, when she lifted a wee white hand andmotioned me back. I obeyed because I could not help myself--her
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][EMOTION][METAPHOR][PERSPECTIVE][CHARACTER][FLASHBACK][CHARACTERIZATION][EXPOSITION]action was accompanied by a peculiar,--an unpleasantly peculiar,expression that held me spellbound; and without exactly knowing why,I stood staring at her, tongue-tied and trembling. As her face wasturned towards the patient, and she wore, moreover, a verywide-brimmed hat, I could see nothing of her features; but from hergraceful little figure and dainty limbs, I gathered that she wasprobably both beautiful and aristocratic. Her dress, though notperhaps of the richest quality, was certainly far from shoddy, andthere was something in its style and make that suggested foreignnationality,--Italy--or Spain--or South America--or even the Orient,the probability of the latter being strengthened by her pose, whichwas full of the serpent-like ease which is characteristic of theEast. I was so taken up with watching her that I forgot all about mypatient, until a prolonged sigh from the bed reminded me of herexistence. With an effort I then advanced, and was about to approach
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][DANGER][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][EMOTION][CONFLICT][PERSPECTIVE][SETTING][CHARACTER][CONTEXT][TRANSITION][SUSPENSE][HORROR]the bed, when the child, without moving her head, motioned me back,and--again I was helpless. The vision I had obtained of the sickwoman, brief though it was, filled me with alarm. She was tossing toand fro on the blankets, and breathing in the most agonised manner asif in delirium, or enthralled by some particularly dreadfulnightmare. Her condition so frightened me, that I made the mostfrantic efforts to overcome my inertia. I did not succeed, however,
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][RELIEF][SURPRISE][ACTION][TRANSITION]and at last, utterly overcome by my exertion, I closed my eyes. WhenI opened them again, the chair by the bed was vacant--the child hadgone. A tremendous feeling of relief surged through me, and, jumpingout of my seat, I hastened to the bedside--my patient was worse, thefever had increased, and she was delirious. I took her temperature.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][RELIEF][TRANSITION]It was 104. I now sat close beside her, and my presence apparentlyhad a soothing effect. She speedily grew calmer, and after taking hermedicine gradually sank into a gentle sleep which lasted until latein the morning. When I left her she had altogether recovered from therelapse. I, of course, told the doctor of the child's visit, and he
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][DANGER][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][SURPRISE]was very angry.[DIALOGUE]"Whatever happens, Nurse," he said, [DIALOGUE]"take care that no one enters theroom to-night; the patient's condition is far too critical for her tosee any one, even her own daughter. You must keep the door locked."Armed with this mandate, I went on duty the following night with asomewhat lighter heart, and, after locking the door, once again sat bythe fire. During the day there had been a heavy fall of snow; the windhad abated, and the streets were now as silent as the grave.Ten, eleven, and twelve o'clock struck, and my patient slepttranquilly. At a quarter to one, however, I was abruptly roused from areverie by a sob, a sob of fear and agony that proceeded from the bed.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK]I looked, and there--there, seated in the same posture as on theprevious evening, was the child. I sprang to my feet with anexclamation of amazement. She raised her hand, and, as before, Icollapsed--spellbound--paralysed. No words of mine can convey all thesensations I experienced as I sat there, forced to listen to themoaning and groaning of the woman whose fate had been entrusted to mykeeping. Every second she grew worse, and each sound rang in my ears
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CONFLICT][HORROR]like the hammering of nails in her coffin. How long I endured suchtorment I cannot say, I dare not think, for, though the clock waswithin a few feet of me, I never once thought of looking at it. Atlast the child rose, and, moving slowly from the bed, advanced withbowed head towards the window. The spell was broken. With a cry of
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][DANGER][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][DEATH][ACTION][MONSTER]indignation I literally bounded over the carpet and faced theintruder.[DIALOGUE]"Who are you?" I hissed. [DIALOGUE]"Tell me your name instantly! How dare youenter this room without my permission?"As I spoke she slowly raised her head. I snatched at her hat. Itmelted away in my hands, and, to my unspeakable terror, my undyingterror, I looked into the face of a corpse!--the corpse of a Hindoo
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][DEATH][DANGER][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][HORROR]child, with a big, gaping cut in its throat. In its lifetime the childhad, without doubt, been lovely; it was now horrible--horrible withall the ghastly disfigurements, the repellent disfigurements, of along consignment to the grave. I fainted, and, on recovering, found myghostly visitor had vanished, and that my patient was dead. One ofher hands was thrown across her eyes, as if to shut out some object onwhich she feared to look, whilst the other grasped the counterpaneconvulsively.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][CONTEXT][GHOST]It fell to my duty to help pack up her belongings, and among herletters was a large envelope bearing the postmark [DIALOGUE]"Quetta." As we wereon the look-out for some clue as to the address of her relatives, Iopened it. It was merely the cabinet-size photograph of a Hindoochild, but I recognised the dress immediately--it was that of myghostly visitor. On the back of it were these words: [DIALOGUE]"Natalie. May Godforgive us both."Though we made careful inquiries for any information as to Natalie andMiss Vining in Quetta, and advertised freely in the leading Londonpapers, we learned nothing, and in time we were forced to let thematter drop. As far as I know, the ghost of the Hindoo child has neverbeen seen again, but I have heard that the hotel is stillhaunted--haunted by a woman.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][HAUNTED HOUSE]                        CASE XVII    GLAMIS CASTLEOf all the hauntings in Scotland, none has gained such widespreadnotoriety as the hauntings of Glamis Castle, the seat of the Earl ofStrathmore and Kinghorne in Forfarshire.Part of the castle--that part which is the more frequently haunted--isof ancient though uncertain date, and if there is any truth in thetradition that Duncan was murdered there by Macbeth, must, at anyrate, have been in existence at the commencement of the eleventhcentury. Of course, extra buildings have, from time to time, beenadded, and renovations made; but the original structure remains prettynearly the same as it always has been, and is included in a squaretower that occupies a central position, and commands a complete viewof the entire castle.Within this tower--the walls of which are fifteen feet thick--thereis a room, hidden in some unsuspected quarter, that contains a secret(the keynote to one, at least, of the hauntings) which is known onlyto the Earl, his heir (on the attainment of his twenty-firstbirthday), and the factor of the estate.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][CONTEXT]In all probability, the mystery attached to this room would challengebut little attention, were it not for the fact that unearthly noises,which at the time were supposed to proceed from this chamber, havebeen heard by various visitors sleeping in the Square Tower.The following experience is said to have happened to a lady namedBond. I append it more or less in her own words.       *       *       *       *       *It is a good many years since I stayed at Glamis. I was, in fact, but
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]little more than a child, and had only just gone through my firstseason in town. But though young, I was neither nervous norimaginative; I was inclined to be what is termed stolid, that is tosay, extremely matter-of-fact and practical. Indeed, when my friendsexclaimed, [DIALOGUE]"You don't mean to say you are going to stay at Glamis!Don't you know it's haunted?" I burst out laughing.[DIALOGUE]"Haunted!" I said, [DIALOGUE]"how ridiculous! There are no such things asghosts. One might as well believe in fairies."Of course I did not go to Glamis alone--my mother and sister were withme; but whereas they slept in the more modern part of the castle, Iwas, at my own request, apportioned a room in the Square Tower.I cannot say that my choice had anything to do with the secretchamber. That, and the alleged mystery, had been dinned into my ears
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE]so often that I had grown thoroughly sick of the whole thing. No, Iwanted to sleep in the Square Tower for quite a different reason, areason of my own. I kept an aviary; the tower was old; and I naturallyhoped its walls would be covered with ivy and teeming with birds'nests, some of which I might be able to reach--and, I am ashamed tosay, plunder--from my window.Alas, for my expectations! Although the Square Tower was so ancient
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][SURPRISE][GHOST]that in some places it was actually crumbling away--not the sign of aleaf, not the vestige of a bird's nest could I see anywhere; thewalls were abominably, brutally bare. However, it was not long beforemy disappointment gave way to delight; for the air that blew inthrough the open window was so sweet, so richly scented with heatherand honeysuckle, and the view of the broad, sweeping, thickly woodedgrounds so indescribably charming, that, despite my inartistic andunpoetical nature, I was entranced--entranced as I had never beenbefore, and never have been since. [DIALOGUE]"Ghosts!" I said to myself,"ghosts! how absurd! how preposterously absurd! such an adorable spot
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]as this can only harbour sunshine and flowers."I well remember, too--for, as I have already said, I was notpoetical--how much I enjoyed my first dinner at Glamis. The longjourney and keen mountain air had made me hungry, and I thought I hadnever tasted such delicious food--such ideal salmon (from the Esk) andsuch heavenly fruit. But I must tell you that, although I ateheartily, as a healthy girl should, by the time I went to bed I hadthoroughly digested my meal, and was, in fact, quite ready to partakeof a few oatmeal biscuits I found in my dressing-case, and rememberedhaving bought at Perth. It was about eleven o'clock when my maid left
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]me, and I sat for some minutes wrapped in my dressing gown, before theopen window. The night was very still, and save for an occasionalrustle of the wind in the distant tree-tops, the hooting of an owl,the melancholy cry of a peewit and the hoarse barking of a dog, thesilence was undisturbed.The interior of my room was, in nearly every particular, modern.The furniture was not old; there were no grim carvings; nogrotesquely-fashioned tapestries on the walls; no dark cupboards; nogloomy corners;--all was cosy and cheerful, and when I got into bed nothought of bogle or mystery entered my mind.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][DANGER][EMOTION][HORROR]In a few minutes I was asleep, and for some time there was nothing buta blank--a blank in which all identity was annihilated. Then suddenlyI found myself in an oddly-shaped room with a lofty ceiling, and awindow situated at so great a distance from the black oaken floor asto be altogether inaccessible from within. Feeble gleams ofphosphorescent light made their way through the narrow panes, andserved to render distinct the more prominent objects around; but myeyes struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of the wall, one ofwhich inspired me with terror such as I had never felt before. Thewalls were covered with heavy draperies that were sufficient inthemselves to preclude the possibility of any save the loudest ofsounds penetrating without.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][DANGER][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][HORROR]The furniture, if such one could call it, puzzled me. It seemed morefitted for the cell of a prison or lunatic asylum, or even for akennel, than for an ordinary dwelling-room. I could see no chair, onlya coarse deal table, a straw mattress, and a kind of trough. An air ofirredeemable gloom and horror hung over and pervaded everything. As I
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]stood there, I felt I was waiting for something--something that wasconcealed in the corner of the room I dreaded. I tried to reason withmyself, to assure myself that there was nothing there that could hurtme, nothing that could even terrify me, but my efforts were invain--my fears grew. Had I had some definite knowledge as to the causeof my alarm I should not have suffered so much, but it was myignorance of what was there, of what I feared, that made my terror sopoignant. Each second saw the agony of my suspense increase. I dared
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][HORROR]not move. I hardly dare breathe, and I dreaded lest the violentpulsation of my heart should attract the attention of the UnknownPresence and precipitate its coming out. Yet despite the perturbationof my mind, I caught myself analysing my feelings. It was not danger Iabhorred so much, as its absolute effect--fright. I shuddered at the
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][DANGER][CLIMAX][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][HORROR]bare thought of what result the most trivial incident--the creaking ofa board, ticking of a beetle, or hooting of an owl--might have on theintolerable agitation of my soul.In this unnerved and pitiable condition I felt that the period wasbound to come, sooner or later, when I should have to abandon life andreason together in the most desperate of struggles with--fear.At length, something moved. An icy chill ran through my frame, and thehorror of my anticipations immediately reached its culminating point.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]The Presence was about to reveal itself.The gentle rubbing of a soft body on the floor, the crack of a bonyjoint, breathing, another crack, and then--was it my own excitedimagination--or the disturbing influence of the atmosphere--or theuncertain twilight of the chamber that produced before me, in thestygian darkness of the recess, the vacillating and indistinct outlineof something luminous, and horrid? I would gladly have risked futurityto have looked elsewhere--I could not. My eyes were fixed--I wascompelled to gaze steadily in front of me.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][TRANSITION][SETTING]Slowly, very slowly, the thing, whatever it was, took shape.Legs--crooked, misshapen, human legs. A body--tawny and hunched.Arms--long and spidery, with crooked, knotted fingers. A head--large
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]and bestial, and covered with a tangled mass of grey hair that hungaround its protruding forehead and pointed ears in ghastly mockery ofcurls. A face--and herein was the realisation of all my direstexpectations--a face--white and staring, piglike in formation,malevolent in expression; a hellish combination of all things foul andanimal, and yet withal not without a touch of pathos.As I stared at it aghast, it reared itself on its haunches after themanner of an ape, and leered piteously at me. Then, shuffling forward,it rolled over, and lay sprawled out like some ungainly turtle--andwallowed, as for warmth, in the cold grey beams of early dawn.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][HAUNTED HOUSE]At this juncture the handle of the chamber door turned, some oneentered, there was a loud cry--and I awoke--awoke to find the wholetower, walls and rafters, ringing with the most appalling screams Ihave ever heard,--screams of some thing or of some one--for there wasin them a strong element of what was human as well as animal--in thegreatest distress.Wondering what it meant, and more than ever terrified, I sat up in bedand listened,--listened whilst a conviction--the result of intuition,suggestion, or what you will, but a conviction all the same--forced meto associate the sounds with the thing in my dream. And I associatethem still.       *       *       *       *       *It was, I think, in the same year--in the year that the foregoingaccount was narrated to me--that I heard another story of thehauntings at Glamis, a story in connection with a lady whom I willcall Miss Macginney. I append her experience as nearly as possible as
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]she is stated to have told it.       *       *       *       *       *I seldom talk about my adventure, Miss Maginney announced, because somany people ridicule the superphysical, and laugh at the mere mentionof ghosts. I own I did the same myself till I stayed at Glamis; but aweek there quite cured me of scepticism, and I came away a confirmedbeliever.The incident occurred nearly twenty years ago--shortly after my returnfrom India, where my father was then stationed.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE][TRANSITION]It was years since I had been to Scotland, indeed I had only oncecrossed the border and that when I was a babe; consequently I wasdelighted to receive an invitation to spend a few weeks in the land ofmy birth. I went to Edinburgh first--I was born in DrumsheughGardens--and thence to Glamis.It was late in the autumn, the weather was intensely cold, and Iarrived at the castle in a blizzard. Indeed, I do not recollect everhaving been out in such a frightful storm. It was as much as the
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]horses could do to make headway, and when we reached the castle wefound a crowd of anxious faces eagerly awaiting us in the hall.Chilled! I was chilled to the bone, and thought I never should thaw.But the huge fires and bright and cosy atmosphere of the rooms--forthe interior of Glamis was modernised throughout--soon set me right,and by tea time I felt nicely warm and comfortable.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CHARACTER][CHARACTERIZATION][PERSPECTIVE]My bedroom was in the oldest part of the castle--the Square Tower--butalthough I had been warned by some of the guests that it might behaunted, I can assure you that when I went to bed no subject wasfarther from my thoughts than the subject of ghosts. I returned to myroom at about half-past eleven. The storm was then at its height--allwas babel and confusion--impenetrable darkness mingled with thewildest roaring and shrieking; and when I peeped through my casementwindow I could see nothing--the panes were shrouded in snow--snowwhich was incessantly dashed against them with cyclonic fury. I fixeda comb in the window-frame so as not to be kept awake by the constantjarring; and with the caution characteristic of my sex looked intothe wardrobe and under the bed for burglars--though Heaven knows whatI should have done had I found one there--placed a candlestick andmatchbox on the table by my bedside, lest the roof or window should beblown in during the night or any other catastrophe happen, and afterall these preparations got into bed. At this period of my life I was a
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]sound sleeper, and, being somewhat unusually tired after my journey, Iwas soon in a dreamless slumber. What awoke me I cannot say, but Icame to myself with a violent start, such as might have beenoccasioned by a loud noise. Indeed, that was, at first, my impression,and I strained my ears to try and ascertain the cause of it. All was,however, silent. The storm had abated, and the castle and grounds were
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE]wrapped in an almost preternatural hush. The sky had cleared, and theroom was partially illuminated by a broad stream of silvery light thatfiltered softly in through the white and tightly drawn blinds. Afeeling that there was something unnatural in the air, that thestillness was but the prelude to some strange and startling event,gradually came over me. I strove to reason with myself, to argue thatthe feeling was wholly due to the novelty of my surroundings, but myefforts were fruitless. And soon there stole upon me a sensation to
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][SURPRISE][DANGER][CONTEXT][FLASHBACK][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][SETTING][CHARACTERIZATION][PROBLEM]which I had been hitherto an utter stranger--I became afraid. Anirrepressible tremor pervaded my frame, my teeth chattered, my bloodfroze. Obeying an impulse--an impulse I could not resist, I liftedmyself up from the pillows, and, peering fearfully into the shadowyglow that lay directly in front of me--listened. Why I listened I donot know, saving that an instinctive spirit prompted me. At first I
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][EMOTION]could hear nothing, and then, from a direction I could not define,there came a noise, low, distinct, uninterpretative. It was repeatedin rapid succession, and speedily construed itself into the sound ofmailed footsteps racing up the long flight of stairs at the end of thecorridor leading to my room. Dreading to think what it might be, andseized with a wild sentiment of self-preservation, I made franticendeavours to get out of bed and barricade my door. My limbs, however,refused to move. I was paralysed. Nearer and nearer drew the sounds;
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][CONFLICT][DANGER][SURPRISE][ACTION][PROBLEM][HORROR]and I could at length distinguish, with a clearness that petrified myvery soul, the banging and clanging of sword scabbards, and thepanting and gasping of men, sore pressed in a wild and desperate race.And then the meaning of it all came to me with hideous abruptness--itwas a case of pursued and pursuing--the race was for--LIFE. Outside mydoor the fugitive halted, and from the noise he made in trying to drawhis breath, I knew he was dead beat. His antagonist, however, gave himbut scant time for recovery. Bounding at him with prodigious leaps, he
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][HORROR]struck him a blow that sent him reeling with such tremendous forceagainst the door, that the panels, although composed of the stoutestoak, quivered and strained like flimsy matchboard.The blow was repeated; the cry that rose in the victim's throat wasconverted into an abortive gurgling groan; and I heard the ponderousbattle-axe carve its way through helmet, bone, and brain. A momentlater came the sound of slithering armour; and the corpse, slippingsideways, toppled to the ground with a sonorous clang.A silence too awful for words now ensued. Having finished his hideous
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][DANGER][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][MURDER]handiwork, the murderer was quietly deliberating what to do next;whilst my dread of attracting his attention was so great that Iscarcely dare breathe. This intolerable state of things had alreadylasted for what seemed to me a lifetime, when, glancing involuntarilyat the floor, I saw a stream of dark-looking fluid lazily lapping itsway to me from the direction of the door. Another moment and it wouldreach my shoes. In my dismay I shrieked aloud. There was a sudden stir
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]without, a significant clatter of steel, and the next moment--despitethe fact that it was locked--the door slowly opened. The limits of myendurance had now happily been reached, the over-taxed valves of myheart could stand no more--I fainted. On my awakening to consciousnessit was morning, and the welcome sun rays revealed no evidences of thedistressing drama. I own I had a hard tussle before I could make up mymind to spend another night in that room; and my feelings as I shutthe door on my retreating maid, and prepared to get into bed, were notthe most enviable. But nothing happened, nor did I again experience
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][DEATH][MONSTER]anything of the sort till the evening before I left. I had lain downall the afternoon--for I was tired after a long morning's tramp on themoors, a thing I dearly love--and I was thinking it was about time toget up, when a dark shadow suddenly fell across my face.I looked up hastily, and there, standing by my bedside and bendingover me, was a gigantic figure in bright armour.Its visor was up, and what I saw within the casque is stamped for everon my memory. It was the face of the dead--the long since dead--with
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][EXPOSITION][DANGER][METAPHOR][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][CHARACTERIZATION][SURPRISE][CHARACTER][HORROR]the expression--the subtly hellish expression--of the living. As Igazed helplessly at it, it bent lower. I threw up my hands to ward itoff. There was a loud rap at the door. And as my maid softly entered
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]to tell me tea was ready--it vanished.       *       *       *       *       *The third account of the Glamis hauntings was told me as long ago asthe summer of 1893. I was travelling by rail from Perth to Glasgow,and the only other occupant of my compartment was an elderlygentleman, who, from his general air and appearance, might have beena dominie, or member of some other learned profession. I can see himin my mind's eye now--a tall, thin man with a premature stoop. He had
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]white hair, which was brushed forward on either side of his head insuch a manner as suggested a wig; bushy eyebrows; dark, piercing eyes;and a stern, though somewhat sad, mouth. His features were fine andscholarly; he was clean-shaven. There was something abouthim--something that marked him from the general horde--something thatattracted me, and I began chatting with him soon after we left Perth.In the course of a conversation, that was at all events interesting tome, I adroitly managed to introduce the subject of ghosts--then, asever, uppermost in my thoughts.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE]       *       *       *       *       *Well, he said, I can tell you of something rather extraordinary thatmy mother used to say happened to a friend of hers at Glamis. I haveno doubt you are well acquainted with the hackneyed stories inconnection with the hauntings at the castle; for example, Earl Beardieplaying cards with the Devil, and The Weeping Woman without Hands orTongue. You can read about them in scores of books and magazines. Butwhat befel my mother's friend, whom I will call Mrs. Gibbons--for Ihave forgotten her proper name--was apparently of a novel nature. The
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][METAPHOR][SURPRISE][HAUNTED HOUSE]affair happened shortly before Mrs. Gibbons died, and I always thoughtthat what took place might have been, in some way, connected with herdeath.She had driven over to the castle one day--during the absence of theowner--to see her cousin, who was in the employ of the Earl andCountess. Never having been at Glamis before, but having heard so muchabout it, Mrs. Gibbons was not a little curious to see that part ofthe building, called the Square Tower, that bore the reputation ofbeing haunted.Tactfully biding an opportunity, she sounded her relative on thesubject, and was laughingly informed that she might go anywhere aboutthe place she pleased, saving to one spot, namely, [DIALOGUE]"Bluebeard'sChamber"; and there she could certainly never succeed in poking hernose, as its locality was known only to three people, all of whom werepledged never to reveal it. At the commencement of her tour of
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]inspection, Mrs. Gibbons was disappointed--she was disappointed in theTower. She had expected to see a gaunt, grim place, crumbling topieces with age, full of blood-curdling, spiral staircases, and deep,dark dungeons; whereas everything was the reverse. The walls were inan excellent state of preservation--absolutely intact; the roomsbright and cheerful and equipped in the most modern style; there wereno dungeons, at least none on view, and the passages and staircaseswere suggestive of nothing more alarming than--bats! She wasaccompanied for some time by her relative, but, on the latter beingcalled away, Mrs. Gibbons continued her rambles alone. She had
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE]explored the lower premises, and was leisurely examining a handsomelyfurnished apartment on the top floor, when, in crossing from one sideof the room to the other, she ran into something. She lookeddown--nothing was to be seen. Amazed beyond description, she thrustout her hands, and they alighted on an object, which she had littledifficulty in identifying. It was an enormous cask or barrel lying ina horizontal position.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][SURPRISE][CONFLICT]She bent down close to where she felt it, but she could seenothing--nothing but the well-polished boards of the floor. To makesure again that the barrel was there, she gave a little kick--and drewback her foot with a cry of pain. She was not afraid--the sunshine inthe room forbade fear--only exasperated. She was certain a barrel wasthere--that it was objective--and she was angry with herself for notseeing it. She wondered if she were going blind; but the fact that
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][ACTION][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][DANGER]other objects in the room were plainly visible to her, discountenancedsuch an idea. For some minutes she poked and jabbed at the Thing, andthen, seized with a sudden and uncontrollable panic, she turned roundand fled. And as she tore out of the room, along the passage and downthe seemingly interminable flight of stairs, she heard the barrelbehind her in close pursuit-bump--bump--bump!At the foot of the staircase Mrs. Gibbons met her cousin, and, as sheclutched the latter for support, the barrel shot past her, stillcontinuing its descent--bump--bump--bump! (though the steps as far as
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]she could see had ended)--till the sounds gradually dwindled away inthe far distance.Whilst the manifestations lasted, neither Mrs. Gibbons nor her cousinspoke; but the latter, as soon as the sounds had ceased, dragged Mrs.Gibbons away, and, in a voice shaking with terror, cried: [DIALOGUE]"Quick,quick--don't, for Heaven's sake, look round--worse has yet to come."And, pulling Mrs. Gibbons along in breathless haste, sheunceremoniously hustled her out of the Tower.[DIALOGUE]"That was no barrel!" Mrs. Gibbons's cousin subsequently remarked byway of explanation. "I saw it--I have seen it before. Don't ask me todescribe it. I dare not--I dare not even think of it. Whenever it
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE]appears, a certain thing happens shortly afterwards. Don't, don't onany account say a word about it to any one here." And Mrs. Gibbons, mymother told me, came away from Glamis a thousand times more curiousthan she was when she went.       *       *       *       *       *The last story I have to relate is one I heard many years ago, when Iwas staying near Balmoral. A gentleman named Vance, with strong
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE]antiquarian tastes, was staying at an inn near the Strathmore estate,and, roaming abroad one afternoon, in a fit of absent-mindednessentered the castle grounds. It so happened--fortunately for him--thatthe family were away, and he encountered no one more formidable than aman he took to be a gardener, an uncouth-looking fellow, with a hugehead covered with a mass of red hair, hawk-like features, and highcheek-bones, high even for a Scot. Struck with the appearance of theindividual, Mr. Vance spoke, and, finding him wonderfully civil, askedwhether, by any chance, he ever came across any fossils, when diggingin the gardens.[DIALOGUE]"I dinna ken the meaning of fossils," the man replied. [DIALOGUE]"What arethey?"Mr. Vance explained, and a look of cunning gradually pervaded thefellow's features. [DIALOGUE]"No!" he said, "I've never found any of those
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][FLASHBACK][EMOTION][HAUNTED HOUSE]things, but if you'll give me your word to say nothing about it, I'llshow you something I once dug up over yonder by the Square Tower.[DIALOGUE]""Do you mean the Haunted Tower?--the Tower that is supposed to containthe secret room?[DIALOGUE]" Mr. Vance exclaimed.An extraordinary expression--an expression such as Mr. Vance found itimpossible to analyse--came into the man's eyes. "Yes! that's it![DIALOGUE]" henodded. "What people call--and rightly call--the Haunted Tower. I got
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE]it from there. But don't you say naught about it!"Mr. Vance, whose curiosity was roused, promised, and the man, politelyrequesting him to follow, led the way to a cottage that stood near by,in the heart of a gloomy wood. To Mr. Vance's astonishment thetreasure proved to be the skeleton of a hand--a hand with abnormallylarge knuckles, and the first joint--of both fingers and thumb--muchshorter than the others. It was the most extraordinarily shaped hand
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][CONFLICT]Mr. Vance had ever seen, and he did not know in the least how toclassify it. It repelled, yet interested him, and he eventuallyoffered the man a good sum to allow him to keep it. To hisastonishment the money was refused. "You may have the thing, and
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]welcome,[DIALOGUE]" the fellow said. "Only, I advise you not to look at it lateat night; or just before getting into bed. If you do, you may have baddreams.[DIALOGUE]""I will take my chance of that![DIALOGUE]" Mr. Vance laughed. "You see, being ahard-headed cockney, I am not superstitious. It is only youHighlanders, and your first cousins the Irish, who believe nowadays inbogles, omens, and such-like"; and, packing the hand carefully in hisknapsack, Mr. Vance bid the strange-looking creature good morning, andwent on his way.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][EMOTION][PROBLEM][FLASHBACK]For the rest of the day the hand was uppermost in histhoughts--nothing had ever fascinated him so much. He sat ponderingover it the whole evening, and bedtime found him still examiningit--examining it upstairs in his room by candlelight. He had a hazyrecollection that some clock had struck twelve, and he was beginningto feel that it was about time to retire, when, in the mirror oppositehim, he caught sight of the door--it was open.[DIALOGUE]"By Jove! that's odd!" he said to himself. [DIALOGUE]"I could have sworn I shutand bolted it." To make sure, he turned round--the door was closed.
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][DIALOGUE]"An optical delusion," he murmured; [DIALOGUE]"I will try again."He looked into the mirror--the door reflected in it was--open. Utterlyat a loss to know how to explain the phenomenon, he leaned forward inhis seat to examine the glass more carefully, and as he did so hegave a start. On the threshold of the doorway was a shadow--black andbulbous. A cold shiver ran down Mr. Vance's spine, and just for amoment he felt afraid, terribly afraid; but he quickly composedhimself--it was nothing but an illusion--there was no shadow there inreality--he had only to turn round, and the thing would be gone. It
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][SUSPENSE][TRANSITION][METAPHOR][COMEDIC HORROR]was amusing--entertaining. He would wait and see what happened.The shadow moved. It moved slowly through the air like some hugespider, or odd-shaped bird. He would not acknowledge that there was
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][HORROR]anything sinister about it--only something droll--excruciatingly droll.Yet it did not make him laugh. When it had drawn a little nearer, hetried to diagnose it, to discover its material counterpart in one ofthe objects around him; but he was obliged to acknowledge his attemptswere failures--there was nothing in the room in the least degree likeit. A vague feeling of uneasiness gradually crept over him--was thething the shadow of something with which he was familiar, but could notjust then recall to mind--something he feared--something that wassinister? He struggled against the idea, he dismissed it as absurd; but
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][EMOTION][HORROR]it returned--returned, and took deeper root as the shadow drew nearer.He wished the house was not quite so silent--that he could hear someindication of life--anything--anything for companionship, and to ridhim of the oppressive, the very oppressive, sense of loneliness andisolation.Again a thrill of terror ran through him.[DIALOGUE]"Look here!" he exclaimed aloud, glad to hear the sound of his ownvoice. "Look here! if this goes on much longer I shall begin to think
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][TRANSITION][DANGER]I'm going mad. I have had enough, and more than enough, of magicmirrors for one night--it's high time I got into bed." He strove torise from his chair--to move; he was unable to do either; somestrange, tyrannical force held him a prisoner.A change now took place in the shadow; the blurr dissipated, and theclearly defined outlines of an object--an object that made Mr. Vanceperfectly sick with apprehension--slowly disclosed themselves. His
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][MURDER]suspicions were verified--it was the HAND!--the hand--no longerskeleton, but covered with green, mouldering flesh--feeling its wayslyly and stealthily towards him--towards the back of his chair! Henoted the murderous twitching of its short, flat finger-tips, themonstrous muscles of its hideous thumb, and the great, clumsy hollowsof its clammy palm. It closed in upon him; its cold, slimy, detestableskin touched his coat--his shoulder--his neck--his head! It pressed
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][ACTION][CONFLICT][FLASHBACK]him down, squashed, suffocated him! He saw it all in the glass--andthen an extraordinary thing happened. Mr. Vance suddenly becameanimated. He got up and peeped furtively round. Chairs, bed, wardrobe,
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][SURPRISE][DANGER][MURDER]had all disappeared--so had the bedroom--and he found himself in asmall, bare, comfortless, queerly constructed apartment without adoor, and with only a narrow slit of a window somewhere near theceiling.He had in one of his hands a knife with a long, keen blade, and hiswhole mind was bent on murder. Creeping stealthily forward, heapproached a corner of the room, where he now saw, for the firsttime--a mattress--a mattress on which lay a huddled-up form. What theThing was--whether human or animal--Mr. Vance did not know--did notcare--all he felt was that it was there for him to kill--that heloathed and hated it--hated it with a hatred such as nothing elsecould have produced. Tiptoeing gently up to it, he bent down, and,
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][CHARACTER][MONSTER]lifting his knife high above his head, plunged it into the Thing'sbody with all the force he could command.       *       *       *       *       *He recrossed the room, and found himself once more in his apartment atthe inn. He looked for the skeleton hand--it was not where he had leftit--it had vanished. Then he glanced at the mirror, and on itsbrilliantly polished surface saw--not his own face--but the face ofthe gardener, the man who had given him the hand! Features, colour,
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]hair--all--all were identical--wonderfully, hideously identical--andas the eyes met his, they smiled--devilishly.       *       *       *       *       *Early the next day, Mr. Vance set out for the spinney and cottage;they were not to be found--nobody had ever heard of them. He continuedhis travels, and some months later, at a loan collection of picturesin a gallery in Edinburgh, he came to an abrupt--a very abrupt--halt,before the portrait of a gentleman in ancient costume. The faceseemed strangely familiar--the huge head with thick, red hair--thehawk-like features--the thin and tightly compressed lips. Then, in a
[ELLIOTT O DONNELL]trice, it all came back to him: the face he looked at was that of theuncouth gardener--the man who had given him the hand. And to clinchthe matter, the eyes--leered.                _Printed by_            MORRISON & GIBB LIMITED                _Edinburgh_       *       *       *       *       *    +-----------------------------------------------------------+    | Typographical errors corrected in text:                   |    |                                                           |    | Page  79: 'made a dash as it' at replaced with            |    |           'made a dash at it'                             |    | Page  93: spritualist replaced with spiritualist          |    | Page 232: degreee replaced with degree                    |    | Page 258: accompained replaced with accompanied           |    |                                                           |    | Further Notes:                                            |    |                                                           |    | For those who may wonder about the word 'lolled' on page  |    | 84, it really is a word!
