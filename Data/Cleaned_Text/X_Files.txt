[SURPRISE][DANGER]MULDERWhat's wrong? SCULLYWell, I just climbed up 12 floors, I'm hot, I'm thirsty and to be honest, I'm wondering what I'm doing up here. MULDERYou're looking for a bomb. SCULLYYes, I know that, but the threat was called in to the Federal building across the street. 
[DANGER]MULDERI think they have that covered. SCULLYMulder, when a terrorist bomb threat is called in, the rational purpose of providing that information is to allow us to find the bomb. The rational object of terrorism is to promote terror. If you'd study the statistics, you'd find the model behavioral pattern for virtually every case where a threat has turned up an explosive device; and if we don't act in accordance with that data, if you ignoreit as we have done, the chances are great that if there actually is a bomb, we might not find it. Lives could be lost .... Mulder. Mulder?

[ACTION][DEATH][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][EXPOSITION][GORE]He breaks through, releasing an ocean of goo which encased hernaked body. He jabs her with the syringe containing the vaccine and begins dragging out a tube-like material she had jammed down her throat. Just before he pulls it all out, the vaccine takes effect and the tube starts to shrivel. It's dying and affecting the whole metallic structure as it begins to shake, rattle and roll around them. Scully starts to gulp in air as the tube is removed.]

[CONFLICT][TRANSITION][PROBLEM][METAPHOR][DANGER][SURPRISE][EXPOSITION]If you're not armed, arm yourselves. [Back below, Mulder tries to talk to Scully.]MULDERBreathe! Can you breathe? 
[DANGER][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][WEAPON][MURDER][SCULLY coughs several times. Spitting up what's left of the slimy substance.] SCULLY(in a bare whisper)  Cold. MULDERI'm going to get you out of here. 
[ACTION][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][PROBLEM][DANGER][Mulder pulls her out of her enclosure as he breaks away the last of the ice. Next we see her dressed in some of Mulder's clothing, dragged away from the pods which are now starting to stir from within. The vaccine has affected the whole structure, as the bodies were all obviously attached to one creature.]MULDERWe've got to keep moving.
[CONFLICT][ACTION][PROBLEM][TRANSITION][SURPRISE]SCULLYI can't.MULDERYeah, you can.[MULDER carries her to the vent.]MULDERReach up and grab that vent. Scully, grab the vent! Scully? 
[METAPHOR][TRANSITION][DANGER][PROBLEM][Scully has passed out. Mulder checks for a pulse then resuscitates her with a mean version of CPR.]MULDERBreathe, Scully. Breathe. BREATHE! 
[CONFLICT][DANGER][Spitting up and indicating for MULDER to come closer to her so he can hear her.]SCULLYI had you big time. MULDERGrab the vent. [SCULLY grabs the vent and pulls herself up. MULDER starts to climb 
[CONFLICT][ACTION][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][PROBLEM][WEAPON][DANGER][METAPHOR][ALIEN]up. One of the aliens breaks the pod and reaches out with its hand for MULDER. It grabs MULDER's leg.] SCULLYMulder! 
[ACTION][TRANSITION][CONFLICT]MULDERKeep moving, Scully! [MULDER kicks it away and pulls himself up. They both climb through the tunnel and pull themselves up from where MULDER originally fell through the snow/ice. MULDER looks back and sees that the ice is cracking. He picks SCULLY up and they begin to run away. The
[EMOTION][PERSPECTIVE]cracking ice overtakes them, and they fall back down, but slide off of the surface of the rising ship and land on the edge of the newlyformed crater. MULDER watches the spaceship as it flies overhead,his face glows with a heart-melting grin of childlike wonder and awe. Scully's face is turned towards the snow, too tired to move, as Mulder says, almost along with the audience ...]
MULDERScully, you have to see this![It's quiet, it's barely a mutter above a whisper, but Scully DOES say, [DIALOGUE]"I see it." Spent from exhaustion, Mulder drops his head into the snow and Scully scoots her body over to cover him from the freezing cold. The camera pans back to show two lone figures perched alone on the edge of the crater left by the departing spaceship.]Washington DC OPR CASSIDYIn light report on these findings and in light of the narrative I am now hearing, my official report is incomplete--pending these new facts I'm being asked to reconcile. Agent Scully, though there is 
[PROBLEM]now direct evidence that a federal agent MAY have been involved in the bombing, the other events you've laid down here are too incredibleon their own, and quite frankly implausible in their connections. SCULLYWhat is it you find incredible?CASSIDYWell, where would you like me to start? So many of the events described in your report defy belief. Antarctica is a LONG way 
[PROBLEM]from Dallas, Texas, Agent Scully. I-- I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fit under the rubric of domestic terrorism.SCULLYNo, they don't.
[PROBLEM]CASSIDYMost of what I find in here is lacking a coherent picture of ANY organization with an attributible motive. I realize that the ordeal you've endured has clearly affected you. But the holes in your account leave this panel no choice but to delete these references to our final report to the Justice Department--until which time hard evidence becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation.[SCULLY walks over to her and hands her the vial containing the beefound in Mulder's hallway.]
[SURPRISE][PROBLEM]SCULLYI don't believe the FBI currently has an investigative unit qualified to pursue the evidence in hand.The Capital Mall[SCULLY finds MULDER sitting on a bench by the reflecting pool reading a newspaper.]MULDERThere's an interesting work of fiction on page 24. Mysteriously, our names have been omitted. They're burying this 
[PROBLEM][DANGER][SURPRISE]thing, Scully. They're just going to dig a new hole and cover it up.SCULLYI told OPR everything I know. What I experienced, the virus, how it's spread by the bees from pollen in transgenic crops.
MULDERYou're wasting your time, Scully. They'll never believe you, not unless your story can be programmed, categorized, or easily referenced. SCULLYThen we'll go over their heads. MULDERNo. No. How many times have we been here before, Scully? 
[PERSPECTIVE][FLASHBACK][TRANSITION][CONTEXT]Right here. So close to the truth and now with what we've seen andwhat we know to be right back at the beginning with nothing.SCULLYThis is different, Mulder. MULDERNo it isn't. You were right to want to quit. You were right 
[CONFLICT][CHARACTERIZATION][PROBLEM][EXPOSITION][PERSPECTIVE][PLOT][DANGER][TRANSITION]to want to leave me. You should get as far away from me as you can! I'm not going to watch you die, Scully, because of some hollow personal cause of mine. Go be a doctor. Go be a doctor while you 
[DANGER][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][EXPOSITION][WEAPON]still can.SCULLYI can't. I won't. Mulder, I'll be a doctor, but my work is here with you now. That virus that I was exposed to, whatever it is, it has 
[ACTION][PERSPECTIVE][RESOLUTION][RELIEF][METAPHOR][DANGER][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][WEAPON][CONTEXT]a cure. You held it in your hand. How many other lives can we save?Look. If I quit now, they win.
[MULDER gets up, SCULLY takes his hand and they walk off.]Foum Tataouine, Tunisia[TD NOTEAt some point during the next scene, we see a white tanker truck with the name [DIALOGUE]"Nature's Best Corn Oil" written on theside.][A helicopter arrives by a cornfield in the desert, CSM gets out and walks over to STRUGHOLD.]STRUGHOLDYou look hot and miserable.
