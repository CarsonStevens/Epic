On the big maps this deserted area is painted in a fluffy
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][PERSPECTIVE][CHARACTERIZATION][CONTEXT]blue, growing fainter in color as it leaves the banks, and across it may beseen in large straggling letters the word Sumpfe, meaning marshes.In high flood this great acreage of sand, shingle-beds, and willow-grownislands is almost topped by the water, but in normal seasons the bushesbend and rustle in the free winds, showing their silver leaves to thesunshine in an ever-moving plain of bewildering beauty. These willows neverattain to the dignity of trees; they have no rigid trunks; they remainhumble bushes, with rounded tops and soft outline, swaying on slender stemsthat answer to the least pressure of the wind; supple as grasses, and socontinually shifting that they somehow give the impression that the entireplain is moving and alive. For the wind sends waves rising and falling overthe whole surface, waves of leaves instead of waves of water, green swellslike the sea, too, until the branches turn and lift, and then silvery whiteas their underside turns to the sun.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]Happy to slip beyond the control of the stern banks, the Danube herewanders about at will among the intricate network of channels intersectingthe islands everywhere with broad avenues down which the waters pour with ashouting sound; making whirlpools, eddies, and foaming rapids; tearing atthe sandy banks; carrying away masses of shore and willow-clumps; andforming new islands innumerably which shift daily in size and shape andpossess at best an impermanent life, since the flood-time obliterates theirvery existence.Properly speaking, this fascinating part of the river's life begins soonafter leaving Pressburg, and we, in our Canadian canoe, with gipsy tent andfrying-pan on board, reached it on the crest of a rising flood aboutmid-July. That very same morning, when the sky was reddening beforesunrise, we had slipped swiftly through still-sleeping Vienna, leaving it acouple of hours later a mere patch of smoke against the blue hills of theWienerwald on the horizon; we had breakfasted below Fischeramend under agrove of birch trees roaring in the wind; and had then swept on the tearingcurrent past Orth, Hainburg, Petronell (the old Roman Carnuntum of MarcusAurelius), and so under the frowning heights of Thelsen on a spur of theCarpathians, where the March steals in quietly from the left and thefrontier is crossed between Austria and Hungary.Racing along at twelve kilometers an hour soon took us well into Hungary,and the muddy waters--sure sign of flood--sent us aground on many ashingle-bed, and twisted us like a cork in many a sudden belching whirlpoolbefore the towers of Pressburg (Hungarian, Poszony) showed against the sky;and then the canoe, leaping like a spirited horse, flew at top speed underthe grey walls, negotiated safely the sunken chain of the Fliegende Bruckeferry, turned the corner sharply to the left, and plunged on yellow foaminto the wilderness of islands, sandbanks, and swamp-land beyond--the landof the willows.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][METAPHOR]The change came suddenly, as when a series of bioscope pictures snaps downon the streets of a town and shifts without warning into the scenery oflake and forest. We entered the land of desolation on wings, and in lessthan half an hour there was neither boat nor fishing-hut nor red roof, norany single sign of human habitation and civilization within sight. Thesense of remoteness from the world of humankind, the utter isolation, thefascination of this singular world of willows, winds, and waters, instantlylaid its spell upon us both, so that we allowed laughingly to one anotherthat we ought by rights to have held some special kind of passport to admitus, and that we had, somewhat audaciously, come without asking leave into aseparate little kingdom of wonder and magic--a kingdom that was reservedfor the use of others who had a right to it, with everywhere unwrittenwarnings to trespassers for those who had the imagination to discover them.Though still early in the afternoon, the ceaseless buffetings of a mosttempestuous wind made us feel weary, and we at once began casting about fora suitable camping-ground for the night. But the bewildering character of
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]the islands made landing difficult; the swirling flood carried us in shoreand then swept us out again; the willow branches tore our hands as weseized them to stop the canoe, and we pulled many a yard of sandy bank intothe water before at length we shot with a great sideways blow from the windinto a backwater and managed to beach the bows in a cloud of spray. Then welay panting and laughing after our exertions on the hot yellow sand,sheltered from the wind, and in the full blaze of a scorching sun, acloudless blue sky above, and an immense army of dancing, shouting willowbushes, closing in from all sides, shining with spray and clapping theirthousand little hands as though to applaud the success of our efforts.[DIALOGUE]"What a river!" I said to my companion, thinking of all the way we hadtraveled from the source in the Black Forest, and how he had often beenobliged to wade and push in the upper shallows at the beginning of June.[DIALOGUE]"Won't stand much nonsense now, will it?" he said, pulling the canoe alittle farther into safety up the sand, and then composing himself for anap.I lay by his side, happy and peaceful in the bath of the elements--water,wind, sand, and the great fire of the sun--thinking of the long journeythat lay behind us, and of the great stretch before us to the Black Sea,and how lucky I was to have such a delightful and charming travelingcompanion as my friend, the Swede.We had made many similar journeys together, but the Danube, more than anyother river I knew, impressed us from the very beginning with itsaliveness. From its tiny bubbling entry into the world among the pinewood
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][CHARACTER][METAPHOR]gardens of Donaueschingen, until this moment when it began to play thegreat river-game of losing itself among the deserted swamps, unobserved,unrestrained, it had seemed to us like following the grown of some livingcreature. Sleepy at first, but later developing violent desires as itbecame conscious of its deep soul, it rolled, like some huge fluid being,through all the countries we had passed, holding our little craft on itsmighty shoulders, playing roughly with us sometimes, yet always friendlyand well-meaning, till at length we had come inevitably to regard it as aGreat Personage.How, indeed, could it be otherwise, since it told us so much of its secretlife? At night we heard it singing to the moon as we lay in our tent,uttering that odd sibilant note peculiar to itself and said to be caused bythe rapid tearing of the pebbles along its bed, so great is its hurryingspeed. We knew, too, the voice of its gurgling whirlpools, suddenly
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]bubbling up on a surface previously quite calm; the roar of its shallowsand swift rapids; its constant steady thundering below all mere surfacesounds; and that ceaseless tearing of its icy waters at the banks. How itstood up and shouted when the rains fell flat upon its face! And how itslaughter roared out when the wind blew up-stream and tried to stop itsgrowing speed! We knew all its sounds and voices, its tumblings andfoamings, its unnecessary splashing against the bridges; thatself-conscious chatter when there were hills to look on; the affecteddignity of its speech when it passed through the little towns, far tooimportant to laugh; and all these faint, sweet whisperings when the suncaught it fairly in some slow curve and poured down upon it till the steamrose.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]It was full of tricks, too, in its early life before the great world knewit. There were places in the upper reaches among the Swabian forests, whenyet the first whispers of its destiny had not reached it, where it electedto disappear through holes in the ground, to appear again on the other sideof the porous limestone hills and start a new river with another name;leaving, too, so little water in its own bed that we had to climb out andwade and push the canoe through miles of shallows.And a chief pleasure, in those early days of its irresponsible youth, wasto lie low, like Brer Fox, just before the little turbulent tributariescame to join it from the Alps, and to refuse to acknowledge them when in,but to run for miles side by side, the dividing line well marked, the verylevels different, the Danube utterly declining to recognize the newcomer.Below Passau, however, it gave up this particular trick, for there the Inncomes in with a thundering power impossible to ignore, and so pushes andincommodes the parent river that there is hardly room for them in the longtwisting gorge that follows, and the Danube is shoved this way and thatagainst the cliffs, and forced to hurry itself with great waves and muchdashing to and fro in order to get through in time. And during the fight
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]our canoe slipped down from its shoulder to its breast, and had the time ofits life among the struggling waves. But the Inn taught the old river alesson, and after Passau it no longer pretended to ignore new arrivals.This was many days back, of course, and since then we had come to knowother aspects of the great creature, and across the Bavarian wheat plain ofStraubing she wandered so slowly under the blazing June sun that we couldwell imagine only the surface inches were water, while below there moved,concealed as by a silken mantle, a whole army of Undines, passing silentlyand unseen down to the sea, and very leisurely too, lest they bediscovered.Much, too, we forgave her because of her friendliness to the birds andanimals that haunted the shores. Cormorants lined the banks in lonely
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][TRANSITION]places in rows like short black palings; grey crows crowded theshingle-beds; storks stood fishing in the vistas of shallower water thatopened up between the islands, and hawks, swans, and marsh birds of allsorts filled the air with glinting wings and singing, petulant cries. Itwas impossible to feel annoyed with the river's vagaries after seeing adeer leap with a splash into the water at sunrise and swim past the bows ofthe canoe; and often we saw fawns peering at us from the underbrush, orlooked straight into the brown eyes of a stag as we charged full tilt rounda corner and entered another reach of the river. Foxes, too, everywherehaunted the banks, tripping daintily among the driftwood and disappearingso suddenly that it was impossible to see how they managed it.But now, after leaving Pressburg, everything changed a little, and theDanube became more serious. It ceased trifling. It was half-way to the
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][DANGER][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][PROBLEM]Black Sea, within seeming distance almost of other, stranger countrieswhere no tricks would be permitted or understood. It became suddenlygrown-up, and claimed our respect and even our awe. It broke out into threearms, for one thing, that only met again a hundred kilometers farther down,and for a canoe there were no indications which one was intended to befollowed.[DIALOGUE]"If you take a side channel," said the Hungarian officer we met in thePressburg shop while buying provisions, "you may find yourselves, when theflood subsides, forty miles from anywhere, high and dry, and you may easilystarve. There are no people, no farms, no fishermen. I warn you not to
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]continue. The river, too, is still rising, and this wind will increase."The rising river did not alarm us in the least, but the matter of beingleft high and dry by a sudden subsidence of the waters might be serious,and we had consequently laid in an extra stock of provisions. For the rest,the officer's prophecy held true, and the wind, blowing down a perfectlyclear sky, increased steadily till it reached the dignity of a westerlygale.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]It was earlier than usual when we camped, for the sun was a good hour ortwo from the horizon, and leaving my friend still asleep on the hot sand, Iwandered about in desultory examination of our hotel. The island, I found,was less than an acre in extent, a mere sandy bank standing some two orthree feet above the level of the river. The far end, pointing into thesunset, was covered with flying spray which the tremendous wind drove offthe crests of the broken waves. It was triangular in shape, with the apexup stream.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][METAPHOR]I stood there for several minutes, watching the impetuous crimson floodbearing down with a shouting roar, dashing in waves against the bank asthough to sweep it bodily away, and then swirling by in two foaming streamson either side. The ground seemed to shake with the shock and rush, whilethe furious movement of the willow bushes as the wind poured over themincreased the curious illusion that the island itself actually moved.Above, for a mile or two, I could see the great river descending upon me;it was like looking up the slope of a sliding hill, white with foam, andleaping up everywhere to show itself to the sun.The rest of the island was too thickly grown with willows to make walkingpleasant, but I made the tour, nevertheless. From the lower end the light,
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][PROBLEM][CONFLICT]of course, changed, and the river looked dark and angry. Only the backs ofthe flying waves were visible, streaked with foam, and pushed forcibly bythe great puffs of wind that fell upon them from behind. For a short mileit was visible, pouring in and out among the islands, and then disappearingwith a huge sweep into the willows, which closed about it like a herd ofmonstrous antediluvian creatures crowding down to drink. They made me thinkof gigantic sponge-like growths that sucked the river up into themselves.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][EMOTION][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][DANGER][CONFLICT][SUSPENSE]They caused it to vanish from sight. They herded there together in suchoverpowering numbers.Altogether it was an impressive scene, with its utter loneliness, itsbizarre suggestion; and as I gazed, long and curiously, a singular emotionbegan to stir somewhere in the depths of me. Midway in my delight of thewild beauty, there crept, unbidden and unexplained, a curious feeling ofdisquietude, almost of alarm.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][METAPHOR][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE]A rising river, perhaps, always suggests something of the ominous; many ofthe little islands I saw before me would probably have been swept away bythe morning; this resistless, thundering flood of water touched the senseof awe. Yet I was aware that my uneasiness lay deeper far than the emotionsof awe and wonder. It was not that I felt. Nor had it directly to do withthe power of the driving wind--this shouting hurricane that might almostcarry up a few acres of willows into the air and scatter them like so muchchaff over the landscape. The wind was simply enjoying itself, for nothing
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][EMOTION][SURPRISE]rose out of the flat landscape to stop it, and I was conscious of sharingits great game with a kind of pleasurable excitement. Yet this novelemotion had nothing to do with the wind. Indeed, so vague was the sense ofdistress I experienced, that it was impossible to trace it to its sourceand deal with it accordingly, though I was aware somehow that it had to dowith my realization of our utter insignificance before this unrestrainedpower of the elements about me. The huge-grown river had something to dowith it too--a vague, unpleasant idea that we had somehow trifled withthese great elemental forces in whose power we lay helpless every hour ofthe day and night. For here, indeed, they were gigantically at play
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][EMOTION]together, and the sight appealed to the imagination.But my emotion, so far as I could understand it, seemed to attach itselfmore particularly to the willow bushes, to these acres and acres ofwillows, crowding, so thickly growing there, swarming everywhere the eyecould reach, pressing upon the river as though to suffocate it, standing indense array mile after mile beneath the sky, watching, waiting, listening.And, apart quite from the elements, the willows connected themselves subtlywith my malaise, attacking the mind insidiously somehow by reason of theirvast numbers, and contriving in some way or other to represent to theimagination a new and mighty power, a power, moreover, not altogetherfriendly to us.Great revelations of nature, of course, never fail to impress in one way oranother, and I was no stranger to moods of the kind. Mountains overawe and
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][CONTEXT]oceans terrify, while the mystery of great forests exercises a spellpeculiarly its own. But all these, at one point or another, somewhere linkon intimately with human life and human experience. They stircomprehensible, even if alarming, emotions. They tend on the whole toexalt.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][DANGER][EMOTION][PROBLEM][PERSPECTIVE][FLASHBACK][TRANSITION][ALIEN]With this multitude of willows, however, it was something far different, Ifelt. Some essence emanated from them that besieged the heart. A sense ofawe awakened, true, but of awe touched somewhere by a vague terror. Theirserried ranks, growing everywhere darker about me as the shadows deepened,moving furiously yet softly in the wind, woke in me the curious andunwelcome suggestion that we had trespassed here upon the borders of analien world, a world where we were intruders, a world where we were notwanted or invited to remain--where we ran grave risks perhaps!
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][EMOTION][CONFLICT]The feeling, however, though it refused to yield its meaning entirely toanalysis, did not at the time trouble me by passing into menace. Yet itnever left me quite, even during the very practical business of putting upthe tent in a hurricane of wind and building a fire for the stew-pot. Itremained, just enough to bother and perplex, and to rob a most delightfulcamping-ground of a good portion of its charm. To my companion, however, Isaid nothing, for he was a man I considered devoid of imagination. In the
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]first place, I could never have explained to him what I meant, and in thesecond, he would have laughed stupidly at me if I had.There was a slight depression in the center of the island, and here wepitched the tent. The surrounding willows broke the wind a bit.[DIALOGUE]"A poor camp," observed the imperturbable Swede when at last the tent stoodupright, [DIALOGUE]"no stones and precious little firewood. I'm for moving on earlytomorrow--eh? This sand won't hold anything."But the experience of a collapsing tent at midnight had taught us manydevices, and we made the cozy gipsy house as safe as possible, and then setabout collecting a store of wood to last till bed-time. Willow bushes dropno branches, and driftwood was our only source of supply. We hunted the
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][DANGER][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][PROBLEM][ACTION]shores pretty thoroughly. Everywhere the banks were crumbling as the risingflood tore at them and carried away great portions with a splash and agurgle.[DIALOGUE]"The island's much smaller than when we landed," said the accurate Swede."It won't last long at this rate. We'd better drag the canoe close to thetent, and be ready to start at a moment's notice. I shall sleep in my
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]clothes.[DIALOGUE]"He was a little distance off, climbing along the bank, and I heard hisrather jolly laugh as he spoke."By Jove![DIALOGUE]" I heard him call, a moment later, and turned to see what hadcaused his exclamation. But for the moment he was hidden by the willows,and I could not find him."What in the world's this?" I heard him cry again, and this time his voicehad become serious.I ran up quickly and joined him on the bank. He was looking over the river,pointing at something in the water.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][EMOTION][ACTION][DIALOGUE]"Good heavens, it's a man's body!" he cried excitedly. [DIALOGUE]"Look!"A black thing, turning over and over in the foaming waves, swept rapidlypast. It kept disappearing and coming up to the surface again. It was abouttwenty feet from the shore, and just as it was opposite to where we stoodit lurched round and looked straight at us. We saw its eyes reflecting the
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]sunset, and gleaming an odd yellow as the body turned over. Then it gave aswift, gulping plunge, and dived out of sight in a flash.[DIALOGUE]"An otter, by gad!" we exclaimed in the same breath, laughing.It was an otter, alive, and out on the hunt; yet it had looked exactly likethe body of a drowned man turning helplessly in the current. Far below itcame to the surface once again, and we saw its black skin, wet and shiningin the sunlight.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK]Then, too, just as we turned back, our arms full of driftwood, anotherthing happened to recall us to the river bank. This time it really was aman, and what was more, a man in a boat. Now a small boat on the Danube wasan unusual sight at any time, but here in this deserted region, and atflood time, it was so unexpected as to constitute a real event. We stoodand stared.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE]Whether it was due to the slanting sunlight, or the refraction from thewonderfully illumined water, I cannot say, but, whatever the cause, I foundit difficult to focus my sight properly upon the flying apparition. Itseemed, however, to be a man standing upright in a sort of flat-bottomedboat, steering with a long oar, and being carried down the opposite shoreat a tremendous pace. He apparently was looking across in our direction,but the distance was too great and the light too uncertain for us to makeout very plainly what he was about. It seemed to me that he wasgesticulating and making signs at us. His voice came across the water to us
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][EMOTION][PERSPECTIVE]shouting something furiously, but the wind drowned it so that no singleword was audible. There was something curious about the wholeappearance--man, boat, signs, voice--that made an impression on me out ofall proportion to its cause.[DIALOGUE]"He's crossing himself!" I cried. [DIALOGUE]"Look, he's making the sign of theCross!"[DIALOGUE]"I believe you're right," the Swede said, shading his eyes with his handand watching the man out of sight. He seemed to be gone in a moment,melting away down there into the sea of willows where the sun caught themin the bend of the river and turned them into a great crimson wall ofbeauty. Mist, too, had begun to ruse, so that the air was hazy.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][DIALOGUE]"But what in the world is he doing at nightfall on this flooded river?" Isaid, half to myself. [DIALOGUE]"Where is he going at such a time, and what did hemean by his signs and shouting? D'you think he wished to warn us aboutsomething?"[DIALOGUE]"He saw our smoke, and thought we were spirits probably," laughed mycompanion. "These Hungarians believe in all sorts of rubbish; you rememberthe shopwoman at Pressburg warning us that no one ever landed here becauseit belonged to some sort of beings outside man's world! I suppose theybelieve in fairies and elementals, possibly demons, too. That peasant in
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][RELIEF][SURPRISE][CHARACTER][EMOTION][PERSPECTIVE][FLASHBACK]the boat saw people on the islands for the first time in his life,[DIALOGUE]" headded, after a slight pause, "and it scared him, that's all.[DIALOGUE]"The Swede's tone of voice was not convincing, and his manner lackedsomething that was usually there. I noted the change instantly while hetalked, though without being able to label it precisely."If they had enough imagination,[DIALOGUE]" I laughed loudly--I remember trying tomake as much noise as I could--"they might well people a place like thiswith the old gods of antiquity. The Romans must have haunted all thisregion more or less with their shrines and sacred groves and elementaldeities."The subject dropped and we returned to our stew-pot, for my friend was notgiven to imaginative conversation as a rule. Moreover, just then I rememberfeeling distinctly glad that he was not imaginative; his stolid, practicalnature suddenly seemed to me welcome and comforting. It was an admirabletemperament, I felt; he could steer down rapids like a red Indian, shootdangerous bridges and whirlpools better than any white man I ever saw in acanoe. He was a grand fellow for an adventurous trip, a tower of strength
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][RELIEF][EMOTION][CHARACTER][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][TRANSITION][PROBLEM]when untoward things happened. I looked at his strong face and light curlyhair as he staggered along under his pile of driftwood (twice the size ofmine!), and I experienced a feeling of relief. Yes, I was distinctly gladjust then that the Swede was--what he was, and that he never made remarksthat suggested more than they said.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][DIALOGUE]"The river's still rising, though," he added, as if following out somethoughts of his own, and dropping his load with a gasp. [DIALOGUE]"This island willbe under water in two days if it goes on."[DIALOGUE]"I wish the wind would go down," I said. [DIALOGUE]"I don't care a fig for theriver."The flood, indeed, had no terrors for us; we could get off at ten minutes'notice, and the more water the better we liked it. It meant an increasingcurrent and the obliteration of the treacherous shingle-beds that so oftenthreatened to tear the bottom out of our canoe.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][TRANSITION]Contrary to our expectations, the wind did not go down with the sun. Itseemed to increase with the darkness, howling overhead and shaking thewillows round us like straws. Curious sounds accompanied it sometimes, likethe explosion of heavy guns, and it fell upon the water and the island ingreat flat blows of immense power. It made me think of the sounds a planetmust make, could we only hear it, driving along through space.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]But the sky kept wholly clear of clouds, and soon after supper the fullmoon rose up in the east and covered the river and the plain of shoutingwillows with a light like the day.We lay on the sandy patch beside the fire, smoking, listening to the noisesof the night round us, and talking happily of the journey we had alreadymade, and of our plans ahead. The map lay spread in the door of the tent,but the high wind made it hard to study, and presently we lowered thecurtain and extinguished the lantern. The firelight was enough to smoke andsee each other's faces by, and the sparks flew about overhead likefireworks. A few yards beyond, the river gurgled and hissed, and from time
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]to time a heavy splash announced the falling away of further portions ofthe bank.Our talk, I noticed, had to do with the faraway scenes and incidents of ourfirst camps in the Black Forest, or of other subjects altogether remotefrom the present setting, for neither of us spoke of the actual moment morethan was necessary--almost as though we had agreed tacitly to avoiddiscussion of the camp and its incidents. Neither the otter nor theboatman, for instance, received the honor of a single mention, thoughordinarily these would have furnished discussion for the greater part ofthe evening. They were, of course, distinct events in such a place.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][SURPRISE]The scarcity of wood made it a business to keep the fire going, for thewind, that drove the smoke in our faces wherever we sat, helped at the sametime to make a forced draught. We took it in turn to make some foragingexpeditions into the darkness, and the quantity the Swede brought backalways made me feel that he took an absurdly long time finding it; for thefact was I did not care much about being left alone, and yet it alwaysseemed to be my turn to grub about among the bushes or scramble along theslippery banks in the moonlight. The long day's battle with wind andwater--such wind and such water!--had tired us both, and an early bed wasthe obvious program. Yet neither of us made the move for the tent. We lay
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][EMOTION][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][DANGER][CONFLICT]there, tending the fire, talking in desultory fashion, peering about usinto the dense willow bushes, and listening to the thunder of wind andriver. The loneliness of the place had entered our very bones, and silenceseemed natural, for after a bit the sound of our voices became a trifleunreal and forced; whispering would have been the fitting mode ofcommunication, I felt, and the human voice, always rather absurd amid theroar of the elements, now carried with it something almost illegitimate. Itwas like talking out loud in church, or in some place where it was notlawful, perhaps not quite safe, to be overheard.The eeriness of this lonely island, set among a million willows, swept by ahurricane, and surrounded by hurrying deep waters, touched us both, Ifancy. Untrodden by man, almost unknown to man, it lay there beneath the
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][EMOTION][ALIEN]moon, remote from human influence, on the frontier of another world, analien world, a world tenanted by willows only and the souls of willows. Andwe, in our rashness, had dared to invade it, even to make use of it!Something more than the power of its mystery stirred in me as I lay on thesand, feet to fire, and peered up through the leaves at the stars. For thelast time I rose to get firewood.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][DIALOGUE]"When this has burnt up," I said firmly, [DIALOGUE]"I shall turn in," and mycompanion watched me lazily as I moved off into the surrounding shadows.For an unimaginative man I thought he seemed unusually receptive thatnight, unusually open to suggestion of things other than sensory. He toowas touched by the beauty and loneliness of the place. I was not altogetherpleased, I remember, to recognize this slight change in him, and instead ofimmediately collecting sticks, I made my way to the far point of the islandwhere the moonlight on plain and river could be seen to better advantage.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][EMOTION][TRANSITION][FLASHBACK][PERSPECTIVE][PROBLEM]The desire to be alone had come suddenly upon me; my former dread returnedin force; there was a vague feeling in me I wished to face and probe to thebottom.When I reached the point of sand jutting out among the waves, the spell ofthe place descended upon me with a positive shock. No mere [DIALOGUE]"scenery" couldhave produced such an effect. There was something more here, something toalarm.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][ALIEN]I gazed across the waste of wild waters; I watched the whispering willows;I heard the ceaseless beating of the tireless wind; and, one and all, eachin its own way, stirred in me this sensation of a strange distress. But thewillows especially; for ever they went on chattering and talking amongthemselves, laughing a little, shrilly crying out, sometimes sighing--butwhat it was they made so much to-do about belonged to the secret life ofthe great plain they inhabited. And it was utterly alien to the world Iknew, or to that of the wild yet kindly elements. They made me think of ahost of beings from another plane of life, another evolution altogether,perhaps, all discussing a mystery known only to themselves. I watched them
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]moving busily together, oddly shaking their big bushy heads, twirling theirmyriad leaves even when there was no wind. They moved of their own will asthough alive, and they touched, by some incalculable method, my own keensense of the horrible.There they stood in the moonlight, like a vast army surrounding our camp,shaking their innumerable silver spears defiantly, formed all ready for anattack.The psychology of places, for some imaginations at least, is very vivid;for the wanderer, especially, camps have their [DIALOGUE]"note" either of welcome orrejection. At first it may not always be apparent, because the busy
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][DANGER][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][EMOTION][PERSPECTIVE]preparations of tent and cooking prevent, but with the first pause--aftersupper usually--it comes and announces itself. And the note of thiswillow-camp now became unmistakably plain to me; we were interlopers,trespassers; we were not welcomed. The sense of unfamiliarity grew upon meas I stood there watching. We touched the frontier of a region where ourpresence was resented. For a night's lodging we might perhaps be tolerated;
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][DANGER][HORROR]but for a prolonged and inquisitive stay--No! by all the gods of the treesand wilderness, no! We were the first human influences upon this island,and we were not wanted. The willows were against us.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][TRANSITION][SURPRISE]Strange thoughts like these, bizarre fancies, borne I know not whence,found lodgment in my mind as I stood listening. What, I thought, if, afterall, these crouching willows proved to be alive; if suddenly they shouldrise up, like a swarm of living creatures, marshaled by the gods whoseterritory we had invaded, sweep towards us off the vast swamps, boomingoverhead in the night--and then settle down! As I looked it was so easy toimagine they actually moved, crept nearer, retreated a little, huddledtogether in masses, hostile, waiting for the great wind that should finallystart them a-running. I could have sworn their aspect changed a little, andtheir ranks deepened and pressed more closely together.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK][EMOTION][DANGER]The melancholy shrill cry of a night-bird sounded overhead, and suddenly Inearly lost my balance as the piece of bank I stood upon fell with a greatsplash into the river, undermined by the flood. I stepped back just intime, and went on hunting for firewood again, half laughing at the oddfancies that crowded so thickly into my mind and cast their spell upon me.I recalled the Swede's remark about moving on next day, and I was justthinking that I fully agreed with him, when I turned with a start and sawthe subject of my thoughts standing immediately in front of me. He wasquite close. The roar of the elements had covered his approach.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]II[DIALOGUE]"You've been gone so long," he shouted above the wind, [DIALOGUE]"I thought somethingmust have happened to you."But there was that in his tone, and a certain look in his face as well,that conveyed to me more than his usual words, and in a flash I understoodthe real reason for his coming. It was because the spell of the place hadentered his soul too, and he did not like being alone.[DIALOGUE]"River still rising," he cried, pointing to the flood in the moonlight,[DIALOGUE]"and the wind's simply awful."He always said the same things, but it was the cry for companionship thatgave the real importance to his words.[DIALOGUE]"Lucky," I cried back, [DIALOGUE]"our tent's in the hollow. I think it'll hold allright." I added something about the difficulty of finding wood, in order toexplain my absence, but the wind caught my words and flung them across theriver, so that he did not hear, but just looked at me through the branches,nodding his head.[DIALOGUE]"Lucky if we get away without disaster!" he shouted, or words to thateffect; and I remember feeling half angry with him for putting the thoughtinto words, for it was exactly what I felt myself. There was disasterimpending somewhere, and the sense of presentiment lay unpleasantly uponme.We went back to the fire and made a final blaze, poking it up with ourfeet. We took a last look round. But for the wind the heat would have been
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]unpleasant. I put this thought into words, and I remember my friend's replystruck me oddly: that he would rather have the heat, the ordinary Julyweather, than this [DIALOGUE]"diabolical wind."Everything was snug for the night; the canoe lying turned over beside thetent, with both yellow paddles beneath her; the provision sack hanging froma willow-stem, and the washed-up dishes removed to a safe distance from thefire, all ready for the morning meal.We smothered the embers of the fire with sand, and then turned in. The flapof the tent door was up, and I saw the branches and the stars and the whitemoonlight. The shaking willows and the heavy buffetings of the wind against
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][EMOTION][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK]our taut little house were the last things I remembered as sleep came downand covered all with its soft and delicious forgetfulness.Suddenly I found myself lying awake, peering from my sandy mattress throughthe door of the tent. I looked at my watch pinned against the canvas, andsaw by the bright moonlight that it was past twelve o'clock--the thresholdof a new day--and I had therefore slept a couple of hours. The Swede wasasleep still beside me; the wind howled as before; something plucked at myheart and made me feel afraid. There was a sense of disturbance in my
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][EMOTION][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE]immediate neighborhood.I sat up quickly and looked out. The trees were swaying violently to andfro as the gusts smote them, but our little bit of green canvas lay snuglysafe in the hollow, for the wind passed over it without meeting enoughresistance to make it vicious. The feeling of disquietude did not pass,however, and I crawled quietly out of the tent to see if our belongingswere safe. I moved carefully so as not to waken my companion. A curious
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][EMOTION][TRANSITION][MONSTER]excitement was on me.I was half-way out, kneeling on all fours, when my eye first took in thatthe tops of the bushes opposite, with their moving tracery of leaves, madeshapes against the sky. I sat back on my haunches and stared. It wasincredible, surely, but there, opposite and slightly above me, were shapesof some indeterminate sort among the willows, and as the branches swayed inthe wind they seemed to group themselves about these shapes, forming aseries of monstrous outlines that shifted rapidly beneath the moon. Close,
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]about fifty feet in front of me, I saw these things.My first instinct was to waken my companion, that he too might see them,but something made me hesitate--the sudden realization, probably, that Ishould not welcome corroboration; and meanwhile I crouched there staring inamazement with smarting eyes. I was wide awake. I remember saying to myselfthat I was not dreaming.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][CHARACTER][ACTION][PERSPECTIVE][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][CHARACTERIZATION]They first became properly visible, these huge figures, just within thetops of the bushes--immense, bronze-colored, moving, and wholly independentof the swaying of the branches. I saw them plainly and noted, now I came toexamine them more calmly, that they were very much larger than human, andindeed that something in their appearance proclaimed them to be not humanat all. Certainly they were not merely the moving tracery of the branchesagainst the moonlight. They shifted independently. They rose upwards in a
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]continuous stream from earth to sky, vanishing utterly as soon as theyreached the dark of the sky. They were interlaced one with another, makinga great column, and I saw their limbs and huge bodies melting in and out ofeach other, forming this serpentine line that bent and swayed and twistedspirally with the contortions of the wind-tossed trees. They were nude,fluid shapes, passing up the bushes, within the leaves almost--rising up ina living column into the heavens. Their faces I never could see.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][TRANSITION][SURPRISE]Unceasingly they poured upwards, swaying in great bending curves, with ahue of dull bronze upon their skins.I stared, trying to force every atom of vision from my eyes. For a longtime I thought they must every moment disappear and resolve themselves intothe movements of the branches and prove to be an optical illusion. Isearched everywhere for a proof of reality, when all the while I understoodquite well that the standard of reality had changed. For the longer I
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][EMOTION][HAUNTED HOUSE]looked the more certain I became that these figures were real and living,though perhaps not according to the standards that the camera and thebiologist would insist upon.Far from feeling fear, I was possessed with a sense of awe and wonder suchas I have never known. I seemed to be gazing at the personified elementalforces of this haunted and primeval region. Our intrusion had stirred thepowers of the place into activity. It was we who were the cause of the
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]disturbance, and my brain filled to bursting with stories and legends ofthe spirits and deities of places that have been acknowledged andworshipped by men in all ages of the world's history. But, before I couldarrive at any possible explanation, something impelled me to go fartherout, and I crept forward on the sand and stood upright. I felt the groundstill warm under my bare feet; the wind tore at my hair and face; and thesound of the river burst upon my ears with a sudden roar. These things, Iknew, were real, and proved that my senses were acting normally. Yet the
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][EMOTION][SURPRISE]figures still rose from earth to heaven, silent, majestically, in a greatspiral of grace and strength that overwhelmed me at length with a genuinedeep emotion of worship. I felt that I must fall down andworship--absolutely worship.Perhaps in another minute I might have done so, when a gust of wind sweptagainst me with such force that it blew me sideways, and I nearly stumbledand fell. It seemed to shake the dream violently out of me. At least it
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][PERSPECTIVE][TRANSITION]gave me another point of view somehow. The figures still remained, stillascended into heaven from the heart of the night, but my reason at lastbegan to assert itself. It must be a subjective experience, I argued--nonethe less real for that, but still subjective. The moonlight and thebranches combined to work out these pictures upon the mirror of myimagination, and for some reason I projected them outwards and made themappear objective. I knew this must be the case, of course. I took courage,
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][METAPHOR][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][FLASHBACK][HORROR]and began to move forward across the open patches of sand. By Jove, though,was it all hallucination? Was it merely subjective? Did not my reason arguein the old futile way from the little standard of the known?
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][EMOTION][DANGER][CLIMAX][FLASHBACK][TRANSITION][CHARACTER][PROBLEM][HORROR]I only know that great column of figures ascended darkly into the sky forwhat seemed a very long period of time, and with a very complete measure ofreality as most men are accustomed to gauge reality. Then suddenly theywere gone!And, once they were gone and the immediate wonder of their great presencehad passed, fear came down upon me with a cold rush. The esoteric meaningof this lonely and haunted region suddenly flamed up within me, and I beganto tremble dreadfully. I took a quick look round--a look of horror that
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][TRANSITION][HORROR]came near to panic--calculating vainly ways of escape; and then, realizinghow helpless I was to achieve anything really effective, I crept backsilently into the tent and lay down again upon my sandy mattress, firstlowering the door-curtain to shut out the sight of the willows in themoonlight, and then burying my head as deeply as possible beneath theblankets to deaden the sound of the terrifying wind.As though further to convince me that I had not been dreaming, I rememberthat it was a long time before I fell again into a troubled and restlesssleep; and even then only the upper crust of me slept, and underneath therewas something that never quite lost consciousness, but lay alert and on thewatch.But this second time I jumped up with a genuine start of terror. It wasneither the wind nor the river that woke me, but the slow approach ofsomething that caused the sleeping portion of me to grow smaller andsmaller till at last it vanished altogether, and I found myself sittingbolt upright--listening.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]Outside there was a sound of multitudinous little patterings. They had beencoming, I was aware, for a long time, and in my sleep they had first becomeaudible. I sat there nervously wide awake as though I had not slept at all.It seemed to me that my breathing came with difficulty, and that there wasa great weight upon the surface of my body. In spite of the hot night, I
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][CONFLICT]felt clammy with cold and shivered. Something surely was pressing steadilyagainst the sides of the tent and weighing down upon it from above. Was itthe body of the wind? Was this the pattering rain, the dripping of theleaves? The spray blown from the river by the wind and gathering in big
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][TRANSITION][CHARACTERIZATION][METAPHOR][CONTEXT]drops? I thought quickly of a dozen things.Then suddenly the explanation leaped into my mind: a bough from the poplar,the only large tree on the island, had fallen with the wind. Still halfcaught by the other branches, it would fall with the next gust and crushus, and meanwhile its leaves brushed and tapped upon the tight canvassurface of the tent. I raised a loose flap and rushed out, calling to the
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE]Swede to follow.But when I got out and stood upright I saw that the tent was free. Therewas no hanging bough; there was no rain or spray; nothing approached.A cold, grey light filtered down through the bushes and lay on the faintlygleaming sand. Stars still crowded the sky directly overhead, and the wind
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][DANGER][FLASHBACK][EMOTION][ACTION][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][HORROR]howled magnificently, but the fire no longer gave out any glow, and I sawthe east reddening in streaks through the trees. Several hours must havepassed since I stood there before watching the ascending figures, and thememory of it now came back to me horribly, like an evil dream. Oh, howtired it made me feel, that ceaseless raging wind! Yet, though the deeplassitude of a sleepless night was on me, my nerves were tingling with theactivity of an equally tireless apprehension, and all idea of repose wasout of the question. The river I saw had risen further. Its thunder filled
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]the air, and a fine spray made itself felt through my thin sleeping shirt.Yet nowhere did I discover the slightest evidence of anything to causealarm. This deep, prolonged disturbance in my heart remained whollyunaccounted for.My companion had not stirred when I called him, and there was no need towaken him now. I looked about me carefully, noting everything; the
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][EMOTION][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK][CONFLICT]turned-over canoe; the yellow paddles--two of them, I'm certain; theprovision sack and the extra lantern hanging together from the tree; and,crowding everywhere about me, enveloping all, the willows, those endless,shaking willows. A bird uttered its morning cry, and a string of duckpassed with whirring flight overhead in the twilight. The sand whirled, dryand stinging, about my bare feet in the wind.I walked round the tent and then went out a little way into the bush, sothat I could see across the river to the farther landscape, and the sameprofound yet indefinable emotion of distress seized upon me again as I sawthe interminable sea of bushes stretching to the horizon, looking ghostlyand unreal in the wan light of dawn. I walked softly here and there, still
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][DANGER]puzzling over that odd sound of infinite pattering, and of that pressureupon the tent that had wakened me. It must have been the wind, Ireflected--the wind bearing upon the loose, hot sand, driving the dryparticles smartly against the taut canvas--the wind dropping heavily uponour fragile roof.Yet all the time my nervousness and malaise increased appreciably.I crossed over to the farther shore and noted how the coast-line hadaltered in the night, and what masses of sand the river had torn away. I
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][EMOTION][SURPRISE][DANGER][FLASHBACK][HORROR]dipped my hands and feet into the cool current, and bathed my forehead.Already there was a glow of sunrise in the sky and the exquisite freshnessof coming day. On my way back I passed purposely beneath the very busheswhere I had seen the column of figures rising into the air, and midwayamong the clumps I suddenly found myself overtaken by a sense of vastterror. From the shadows a large figure went swiftly by. Someone passed me,
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][ACTION][CHARACTER]as sure as ever man did....
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][EMOTION][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][FLASHBACK][PERSPECTIVE][METAPHOR]It was a great staggering blow from the wind that helped me forward again,and once out in the more open space, the sense of terror diminishedstrangely. The winds were about and walking, I remember saying to myself,for the winds often move like great presences under the trees. Andaltogether the fear that hovered about me was such an unknown and immensekind of fear, so unlike anything I had ever felt before, that it woke asense of awe and wonder in me that did much to counteract its worsteffects; and when I reached a high point in the middle of the island fromwhich I could see the wide stretch of river, crimson in the sunrise, thewhole magical beauty of it all was so overpowering that a sort of wildyearning woke in me and almost brought a cry up into the throat.But this cry found no expression, for as my eyes wandered from the plainbeyond to the island round me and noted our little tent half hidden amongthe willows, a dreadful discovery leaped out at me, compared to which myterror of the walking winds seemed as nothing at all.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][EMOTION][CHARACTERIZATION]For a change, I thought, had somehow come about in the arrangement of thelandscape. It was not that my point of vantage gave me a different view,but that an alteration had apparently been effected in the relation of thetent to the willows, and of the willows to the tent. Surely the bushes nowcrowded much closer--unnecessarily, unpleasantly close. They had movednearer.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][DANGER][SUSPENSE][EMOTION][CONFLICT][PERSPECTIVE][PROBLEM][HORROR]Creeping with silent feet over the shifting sands, drawing imperceptiblynearer by soft, unhurried movements, the willows had come closer during thenight. But had the wind moved them, or had they moved of themselves? Irecalled the sound of infinite small patterings and the pressure upon thetent and upon my own heart that caused me to wake in terror. I swayed for amoment in the wind like a tree, finding it hard to keep my upright positionon the sandy hillock. There was a suggestion here of personal agency, of
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][DANGER][PROBLEM][EMOTION][CONFLICT][PERSPECTIVE][TRANSITION][PLOT][EXPOSITION][CONTEXT][SETTING][CHARACTERIZATION][METAPHOR][HORROR]deliberate intention, of aggressive hostility, and it terrified me into asort of rigidity.Then the reaction followed quickly. The idea was so bizarre, so absurd,that I felt inclined to laugh. But the laughter came no more readily thanthe cry, for the knowledge that my mind was so receptive to such dangerousimaginings brought the additional terror that it was through our minds andnot through our physical bodies that the attack would come, and was coming.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]The wind buffeted me about, and, very quickly it seemed, the sun came upover the horizon, for it was after four o'clock, and I must have stood onthat little pinnacle of sand longer than I knew, afraid to come down toclose quarters with the willows. I returned quietly, creepily, to the tent,first taking another exhaustive look round and--yes, I confess it--making afew measurements. I paced out on the warm sand the distances between thewillows and the tent, making a note of the shortest distance particularly.I crawled stealthily into my blankets. My companion, to all appearances,
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][RELIEF]still slept soundly, and I was glad that this was so. Provided myexperiences were not corroborated, I could find strength somehow to denythem, perhaps. With the daylight I could persuade myself that it was all asubjective hallucination, a fantasy of the night, a projection of theexcited imagination.Nothing further came in to disturb me, and I fell asleep almost at once,utterly exhausted, yet still in dread of hearing again that weird sound ofmultitudinous pattering, or of feeling the pressure upon my heart that hadmade it difficult to breathe.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]The sun was high in the heavens when my companion woke me from a heavysleep and announced that the porridge was cooked and there was just time tobathe. The grateful smell of frizzling bacon entered the tent door.[DIALOGUE]"River still rising," he said, [DIALOGUE]"and several islands out in mid-stream havedisappeared altogether. Our own island's much smaller."[DIALOGUE]"Any wood left?" I asked sleepily.[DIALOGUE]"The wood and the island will finish tomorrow in a dead heat," he laughed,[DIALOGUE]"but there's enough to last us till then."I plunged in from the point of the island, which had indeed altered a lotin size and shape during the night, and was swept down in a moment to thelanding-place opposite the tent. The water was icy, and the banks flew bylike the country from an express train. Bathing under such conditions wasan exhilarating operation, and the terror of the night seemed cleansed outof me by a process of evaporation in the brain. The sun was blazing hot;
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][PERSPECTIVE][FLASHBACK][CHARACTERIZATION]not a cloud showed itself anywhere; the wind, however, had not abated onelittle jot.Quite suddenly then the implied meaning of the Swede's words flashed acrossme, showing that he no longer wished to leave post-haste, and had changedhis mind. [DIALOGUE]"Enough to last till tomorrow"--he assumed we should stay on theisland another night. It struck me as odd. The night before he was so
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][PERSPECTIVE][EMOTION][FLASHBACK][CHARACTER][METAPHOR]positive the other way. How had the change come about?Great crumblings of the banks occurred at breakfast, with heavy splashingsand clouds of spray which the wind brought into our frying-pan, and myfellow-traveler talked incessantly about the difficulty the Vienna-Pesthsteamers must have to find the channel in flood. But the state of his mindinterested and impressed me far more than the state of the river or thedifficulties of the steamers. He had changed somehow since the evening
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][EMOTION][CHARACTER][CONFLICT][PERSPECTIVE]before. His manner was different--a trifle excited, a trifle shy, with asort of suspicion about his voice and gestures. I hardly know how todescribe it now in cold blood, but at the time I remember being quitecertain of one thing--that he had become frightened?He ate very little breakfast, and for once omitted to smoke his pipe. He
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][EMOTION][CONFLICT]had the map spread open beside him, and kept studying its markings.[DIALOGUE]"We'd better get off sharp in an hour," I said presently, feeling for anopening that must bring him indirectly to a partial confession at any rate.And his answer puzzled me uncomfortably: [DIALOGUE]"Rather! If they'll let us."[DIALOGUE]"Who'll let us? The elements?" I asked quickly, with affected indifference.[DIALOGUE]"The powers of this awful place, whoever they are," he replied, keeping hiseyes on the map. [DIALOGUE]"The gods are here, if they are anywhere at all in theworld."[DIALOGUE]"The elements are always the true immortals," I replied, laughing asnaturally as I could manage, yet knowing quite well that my face reflectedmy true feelings when he looked up gravely at me and spoke across thesmoke:[DIALOGUE]"We shall be fortunate if we get away without further disaster."This was exactly what I had dreaded, and I screwed myself up to the pointof the direct question. It was like agreeing to allow the dentist toextract the tooth; it had to come anyhow in the long run, and the rest wasall pretence.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][DANGER][DIALOGUE]"Further disaster! Why, what's happened?"[DIALOGUE]"For one thing--the steering paddle's gone," he said quietly.[DIALOGUE]"The steering paddle gone!" I repeated, greatly excited, for this was ourrudder, and the Danube in flood without a rudder was suicide. [DIALOGUE]"But what--"[DIALOGUE]"And there's a tear in the bottom of the canoe," he added, with a genuinelittle tremor in his voice.I continued staring at him, able only to repeat the words in his facesomewhat foolishly. There, in the heat of the sun, and on this burningsand, I was aware of a freezing atmosphere descending round us. I got up to
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][FLASHBACK]follow him, for he merely nodded his head gravely and led the way towardsthe tent a few yards on the other side of the fireplace. The canoe stilllay there as I had last seen her in the night, ribs uppermost, the paddles,or rather, the paddle, on the sand beside her.[DIALOGUE]"There's only one," he said, stooping to pick it up. [DIALOGUE]"And here's the rentin the base-board."It was on the tip of my tongue to tell him that I had clearly noticed twopaddles a few hours before, but a second impulse made me think better ofit, and I said nothing. I approached to see.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]There was a long, finely made tear in the bottom of the canoe where alittle slither of wood had been neatly taken clean out; it looked as if thetooth of a sharp rock or snag had eaten down her length, and investigationshowed that the hole went through. Had we launched out in her withoutobserving it we must inevitably have foundered. At first the water wouldhave made the wood swell so as to close the hole, but once out inmid-stream the water must have poured in, and the canoe, never more thantwo inches above the surface, would have filled and sunk very rapidly.[DIALOGUE]"There, you see an attempt to prepare a victim for the sacrifice," I heardhim saying, more to himself than to me, [DIALOGUE]"two victims rather," he added ashe bent over and ran his fingers along the slit.I began to whistle--a thing I always do unconsciously when utterlynonplussed--and purposely paid no attention to his words. I was determined
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]to consider them foolish.[DIALOGUE]"It wasn't there last night," he said presently, straightening up from hisexamination and looking anywhere but at me.[DIALOGUE]"We must have scratched her in landing, of course," I stopped whistling tosay. [DIALOGUE]"The stones are very sharp."I stopped abruptly, for at that moment he turned round and met my eyesquarely. I knew just as well as he did how impossible my explanation was.There were no stones, to begin with.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][EMOTION][DIALOGUE]"And then there's this to explain too," he added quietly, handing me thepaddle and pointing to the blade.A new and curious emotion spread freezingly over me as I took and examinedit. The blade was scraped down all over, beautifully scraped, as thoughsomeone had sand-papered it with care, making it so thin that the firstvigorous stroke must have snapped it off at the elbow.[DIALOGUE]"One of us walked in his sleep and did this thing," I said feebly, [DIALOGUE]"or--orit has been filed by the constant stream of sand particles blown against itby the wind, perhaps."[DIALOGUE]"Ah," said the Swede, turning away, laughing a little, [DIALOGUE]"you can explaineverything."[DIALOGUE]"The same wind that caught the steering paddle and flung it so near thebank that it fell in with the next lump that crumbled," I called out afterhim, absolutely determined to find an explanation for everything he showedme.[DIALOGUE]"I see," he shouted back, turning his head to look at me beforedisappearing among the willow bushes.Once alone with these perplexing evidences of personal agency, I think myfirst thoughts took the form of [DIALOGUE]"One of us must have done this thing, andit certainly was not I." But my second thought decided how impossible itwas to suppose, under all the circumstances, that either of us had done it.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][METAPHOR][EMOTION][PERSPECTIVE]That my companion, the trusted friend of a dozen similar expeditions, couldhave knowingly had a hand in it, was a suggestion not to be entertained fora moment. Equally absurd seemed the explanation that this imperturbable anddensely practical nature had suddenly become insane and was busied withinsane purposes.Yet the fact remained that what disturbed me most, and kept my fearactively alive even in this blaze of sunshine and wild beauty, was theclear certainty that some curious alteration had come about in hismind--that he was nervous, timid, suspicious, aware of goings on he did notspeak about, watching a series of secret and hitherto unmentionableevents--waiting, in a word, for a climax that he expected, and, I thought,expected very soon. This grew up in my mind intuitively--I hardly knew how.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]I made a hurried examination of the tent and its surroundings, but themeasurements of the night remained the same. There were deep hollows formedin the sand I now noticed for the first time, basin-shaped and of variousdepths and sizes, varying from that of a tea-cup to a large bowl. The wind,no doubt, was responsible for these miniature craters, just as it was forlifting the paddle and tossing it towards the water. The rent in the canoewas the only thing that seemed quite inexplicable; and, after all, it wasconceivable that a sharp point had caught it when we landed. The
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][METAPHOR][PERSPECTIVE]examination I made of the shore did not assist this theory, but all thesame I clung to it with that diminishing portion of my intelligence which Icalled my [DIALOGUE]"reason." An explanation of some kind was an absolute necessity,just as some working explanation of the universe is necessary--howeverabsurd--to the happiness of every individual who seeks to do his duty inthe world and face the problems of life. The simile seemed to me at thetime an exact parallel.I at once set the pitch melting, and presently the Swede joined me at thework, though under the best conditions in the world the canoe could not besafe for traveling till the following day. I drew his attention casually tothe hollows in the sand.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][DIALOGUE]"Yes," he said, [DIALOGUE]"I know. They're all over the island. But you can explainthem, no doubt!"[DIALOGUE]"Wind, of course," I answered without hesitation. [DIALOGUE]"Have you never watchedthose little whirlwinds in the street that twist and twirl everything intoa circle? This sand's loose enough to yield, that's all."He made no reply, and we worked on in silence for a bit. I watched himsurreptitiously all the time, and I had an idea he was watching me. Heseemed, too, to be always listening attentively to something I could nothear, or perhaps for something that he expected to hear, for he keptturning about and staring into the bushes, and up into the sky, and outacross the water where it was visible through the openings among thewillows. Sometimes he even put his hand to his ear and held it there for
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][EMOTION]several minutes. He said nothing to me, however, about it, and I asked noquestions. And meanwhile, as he mended that torn canoe with the skill andaddress of a red Indian, I was glad to notice his absorption in the work,for there was a vague dread in my heart that he would speak of the changedaspect of the willows. And, if he had noticed that, my imagination could nolonger be held a sufficient explanation of it.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE]IIIAt length, after a long pause, he began to talk.[DIALOGUE]"Queer thing," he added in a hurried sort of voice, as though he wanted tosay something and get it over. [DIALOGUE]"Queer thing. I mean, about that otter lastnight."I had expected something so totally different that he caught me withsurprise, and I looked up sharply.[DIALOGUE]"Shows how lonely this place is. Otters are awfully shy things--"[DIALOGUE]"I don't mean that, of course," he interrupted. "I mean--do you think--did
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][FLASHBACK][EMOTION][SURPRISE]you think it really was an otter?[DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE]""What else, in the name of Heaven, what else?""You know, I saw it before you did, and at first it seemed--so much biggerthan an otter.""The sunset as you looked up-stream magnified it, or something,[DIALOGUE]" I replied.He looked at me absently a moment, as though his mind were busy with otherthoughts."It had such extraordinary yellow eyes,[DIALOGUE]" he went on half to himself."That was the sun too,[DIALOGUE]" I laughed, a trifle boisterously. "I suppose you'llwonder next if that fellow in the boat--"I suddenly decided not to finish the sentence. He was in the act again of
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE]listening, turning his head to the wind, and something in the expression ofhis face made me halt. The subject dropped, and we went on with ourcaulking. Apparently he had not noticed my unfinished sentence. Fiveminutes later, however, he looked at me across the canoe, the smoking pitchin his hand, his face exceedingly grave.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][DIALOGUE]"I did rather wonder, if you want to know," he said slowly, [DIALOGUE]"what thatthing in the boat was. I remember thinking at the time it was not a man.The whole business seemed to rise quite suddenly out of the water."I laughed again boisterously in his face, but this time there wasimpatience, and a strain of anger too, in my feeling.[DIALOGUE]"Look here now," I cried, [DIALOGUE]"this place is quite queer enough without goingout of our way to imagine things! That boat was an ordinary boat, and theman in it was an ordinary man, and they were both going down-stream as fastas they could lick. And that otter was an otter, so don't let's play thefool about it!"He looked steadily at me with the same grave expression. He was not in theleast annoyed. I took courage from his silence.[DIALOGUE]"And, for Heaven's sake," I went on, [DIALOGUE]"don't keep pretending you hearthings, because it only gives me the jumps, and there's nothing to hear butthe river and this cursed old thundering wind."[DIALOGUE]"You fool!" he answered in a low, shocked voice, "you utter fool. That'sjust the way all victims talk. As if you didn't understand just as well as
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]I do![DIALOGUE]" he sneered with scorn in his voice, and a sort of resignation. "Thebest thing you can do is to keep quiet and try to hold your mind as firm aspossible. This feeble attempt at self-deception only makes the truth harderwhen you're forced to meet it."My little effort was over, and I found nothing more to say, for I knewquite well his words were true, and that I was the fool, not he. Up to acertain stage in the adventure he kept ahead of me easily, and I think Ifelt annoyed to be out of it, to be thus proved less psychic, lesssensitive than himself to these extraordinary happenings, and half ignorantall the time of what was going on under my very nose. He knew from the very
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]beginning, apparently. But at the moment I wholly missed the point of hiswords about the necessity of there being a victim, and that we ourselveswere destined to satisfy the want. I dropped all pretence thenceforward,but thenceforward likewise my fear increased steadily to the climax.[DIALOGUE]"But you're quite right about one thing," he added, before the subjectpassed, [DIALOGUE]"and that is that we're wiser not to talk about it, or even tothink about it, because what one thinks finds expression in words, and whatone says, happens."That afternoon, while the canoe dried and hardened, we spent trying tofish, testing the leak, collecting wood, and watching the enormous flood ofrising water. Masses of driftwood swept near our shores sometimes, and wefished for them with long willow branches. The island grew perceptibly
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][RELIEF][SURPRISE][TRANSITION]smaller as the banks were torn away with great gulps and splashes. Theweather kept brilliantly fine till about four o'clock, and then for thefirst time for three days the wind showed signs of abating. Clouds began togather in the south-west, spreading thence slowly over the sky.This lessening of the wind came as a great relief, for the incessantroaring, banging, and thundering had irritated our nerves. Yet the silence
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][TRANSITION]that came about five o'clock with its sudden cessation was in a mannerquite as oppressive. The booming of the river had everything in its own waythen; it filled the air with deep murmurs, more musical than the windnoises, but infinitely more monotonous. The wind held many notes, rising,falling always beating out some sort of great elemental tune; whereas theriver's song lay between three notes at most--dull pedal notes, that held alugubrious quality foreign to the wind, and somehow seemed to me, in mythen nervous state, to sound wonderfully well the music of doom.It was extraordinary, too, how the withdrawal suddenly of bright sunlighttook everything out of the landscape that made for cheerfulness; and sincethis particular landscape had already managed to convey the suggestion ofsomething sinister, the change of course was all the more unwelcome andnoticeable. For me, I know, the darkening outlook became distinctly more
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][METAPHOR][PERSPECTIVE][HORROR]alarming, and I found myself more than once calculating how soon aftersunset the full moon would get up in the east, and whether the gatheringclouds would greatly interfere with her lighting of the little island.With this general hush of the wind--though it still indulged in occasionalbrief gusts--the river seemed to me to grow blacker, the willows to standmore densely together. The latter, too, kept up a sort of independentmovement of their own, rustling among themselves when no wind stirred, andshaking oddly from the roots upwards. When common objects in this way become charged with the suggestion of horror, they stimulate the imaginationfar more than things of unusual appearance; and these bushes, crowdinghuddled about us, assumed for me in the darkness a bizarre grotesquerie ofappearance that lent to them somehow the aspect of purposeful and livingcreatures. Their very ordinariness, I felt, masked what was malignant and
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][DANGER][METAPHOR][APOCALYPSE]hostile to us. The forces of the region drew nearer with the coming ofnight. They were focusing upon our island, and more particularly uponourselves. For thus, somehow, in the terms of the imagination, did myreally indescribable sensations in this extraordinary place presentthemselves.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]I had slept a good deal in the early afternoon, and had thus recoveredsomewhat from the exhaustion of a disturbed night, but this only servedapparently to render me more susceptible than before to the obsessing spellof the haunting. I fought against it, laughing at my feelings as absurd andchildish, with very obvious physiological explanations, yet, in spite ofevery effort, they gained in strength upon me so that I dreaded the nightas a child lost in a forest must dread the approach of darkness.The canoe we had carefully covered with a waterproof sheet during the day,and the one remaining paddle had been securely tied by the Swede to thebase of a tree, lest the wind should rob us of that too. From five o'clockonwards I busied myself with the stew-pot and preparations for dinner, itbeing my turn to cook that night. We had potatoes, onions, bits of bacon
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]fat to add flavor, and a general thick residue from former stews at thebottom of the pot; with black bread broken up into it the result was mostexcellent, and it was followed by a stew of plums with sugar and a brew ofstrong tea with dried milk. A good pile of wood lay close at hand, and theabsence of wind made my duties easy. My companion sat lazily watching me,dividing his attentions between cleaning his pipe and giving uselessadvice--an admitted privilege of the off-duty man. He had been very quietall the afternoon, engaged in re-caulking the canoe, strengthening the tentropes, and fishing for driftwood while I slept. No more talk about
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]undesirable things had passed between us, and I think his only remarks hadto do with the gradual destruction of the island, which he declared was notfully a third smaller than when we first landed.The pot had just begun to bubble when I heard his voice calling to me fromthe bank, where he had wandered away without my noticing. I ran up.[DIALOGUE]"Come and listen," he said, [DIALOGUE]"and see what you make of it." He held his handcupwise to his ear, as so often before.[DIALOGUE]"Now do you hear anything?" he asked, watching me curiously.We stood there, listening attentively together. At first I heard only the
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][TRANSITION][SURPRISE]deep note of the water and the hissings rising from its turbulent surface.The willows, for once, were motionless and silent. Then a sound began toreach my ears faintly, a peculiar sound--something like the humming of adistant gong. It seemed to come across to us in the darkness from the wasteof swamps and willows opposite. It was repeated at regular intervals, but
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][EMOTION][METAPHOR]it was certainly neither the sound of a bell nor the hooting of a distantsteamer. I can liken it to nothing so much as to the sound of an immensegong, suspended far up in the sky, repeating incessantly its muffledmetallic note, soft and musical, as it was repeatedly struck. My heartquickened as I listened.[DIALOGUE]"I've heard it all day," said my companion. "While you slept this afternoonit came all round the island. I hunted it down, but could never get near
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]enough to see--to localize it correctly. Sometimes it was overhead, andsometimes it seemed under the water. Once or twice, too, I could have swornit was not outside at all, but within myself--you know--the way a sound inthe fourth dimension is supposed to come."I was too much puzzled to pay much attention to his words. I listened
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]carefully, striving to associate it with any known familiar sound I couldthink of, but without success. It changed in the direction, too, comingnearer, and then sinking utterly away into remote distance. I cannot saythat it was ominous in quality, because to me it seemed distinctly musical,yet I must admit it set going a distressing feeling that made me wish I hadnever heard it.[DIALOGUE]"The wind blowing in those sand-funnels," I said determined to find anexplanation, [DIALOGUE]"or the bushes rubbing together after the storm perhaps."[DIALOGUE]"It comes off the whole swamp," my friend answered. [DIALOGUE]"It comes fromeverywhere at once." He ignored my explanations. "It comes from the willow
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][DANGER][PROBLEM][TRANSITION][EMOTION][PERSPECTIVE][SUSPENSE][HORROR]bushes somehow--[DIALOGUE]""But now the wind has dropped,[DIALOGUE]" I objected. "The willows can hardly make anoise by themselves, can they?[DIALOGUE]"His answer frightened me, first because I had dreaded it, and secondly,because I knew intuitively it was true."It is because the wind has dropped we now hear it. It was drowned before.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][DANGER][SUSPENSE][EMOTION][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][PROBLEM][SURPRISE]It is the cry, I believe, of the--"I dashed back to my fire, warned by the sound of bubbling that the stew wasin danger, but determined at the same time to escape further conversation.I was resolute, if possible, to avoid the exchanging of views. I dreaded,too, that he would begin about the gods, or the elemental forces, orsomething else disquieting, and I wanted to keep myself well in hand forwhat might happen later. There was another night to be faced before weescaped from this distressing place, and there was no knowing yet what itmight bring forth.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][DIALOGUE]"Come and cut up bread for the pot," I called to him, vigorously stirringthe appetizing mixture. That stew-pot held sanity for us both, and thethought made me laugh.He came over slowly and took the provision sack from the tree, fumbling inits mysterious depths, and then emptying the entire contents upon theground-sheet at his feet.[DIALOGUE]"Hurry up!" I cried; [DIALOGUE]"it's boiling."The Swede burst out into a roar of laughter that startled me. It was forcedlaughter, not artificial exactly, but mirthless.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][DIALOGUE]"There's nothing here!" he shouted, holding his sides.[DIALOGUE]"Bread, I mean."[DIALOGUE]"It's gone. There is no bread. They've taken it!"I dropped the long spoon and ran up. Everything the sack had contained layupon the ground-sheet, but there was no loaf.The whole dead weight of my growing fear fell upon me and shook me. Then Iburst out laughing too. It was the only thing to do: and the sound of my
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][TRANSITION]laughter also made me understand his. The stain of psychical pressurecaused it--this explosion of unnatural laughter in both of us; it was aneffort of repressed forces to seek relief; it was a temporary safety-valve.And with both of us it ceased quite suddenly.[DIALOGUE]"How criminally stupid of me!" I cried, still determined to be consistentand find an explanation. "I clean forgot to buy a loaf at Pressburg. That
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]chattering woman put everything out of my head, and I must have left itlying on the counter or--[DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE]""The oatmeal, too, is much less than it was this morning,[DIALOGUE]" the Swedeinterrupted.Why in the world need he draw attention to it? I thought angrily."There's enough for tomorrow,[DIALOGUE]" I said, stirring vigorously, "and we can getlots more at Komorn or Gran. In twenty-four hours we shall be miles fromhere.""I hope so--to God,[DIALOGUE]" he muttered, putting the things back into the sack,"unless we're claimed first as victims for the sacrifice," he added with afoolish laugh. He dragged the sack into the tent, for safety's sake, Isuppose, and I heard him mumbling to himself, but so indistinctly that itseemed quite natural for me to ignore his words.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][METAPHOR][DANGER][TRANSITION][PROBLEM][EMOTION][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK][PERSPECTIVE]Our meal was beyond question a gloomy one, and we ate it almost in silence,avoiding one another's eyes, and keeping the fire bright. Then we washed upand prepared for the night, and, once smoking, our minds unoccupied withany definite duties, the apprehension I had felt all day long became moreand more acute. It was not then active fear, I think, but the veryvagueness of its origin distressed me far more that if I had been able toticket and face it squarely. The curious sound I have likened to the noteof a gong became now almost incessant, and filled the stillness of thenight with a faint, continuous ringing rather than a series of distinctnotes. At one time it was behind and at another time in front of us.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][METAPHOR]Sometimes I fancied it came from the bushes on our left, and then againfrom the clumps on our right. More often it hovered directly overhead likethe whirring of wings. It was really everywhere at once, behind, in front,at our sides and over our heads, completely surrounding us. The soundreally defies description. But nothing within my knowledge is like that
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][DANGER][SURPRISE][PROBLEM]ceaseless muffled humming rising off the deserted world of swamps andwillows.We sat smoking in comparative silence, the strain growing every minutegreater. The worst feature of the situation seemed to me that we did notknow what to expect, and could therefore make no sort of preparation by wayof defense. We could anticipate nothing. My explanations made in the
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]sunshine, moreover, now came to haunt me with their foolish and whollyunsatisfactory nature, and it was more and more clear to us that some kindof plain talk with my companion was inevitable, whether I liked it or not.After all, we had to spend the night together, and to sleep in the sametent side by side. I saw that I could not get along much longer without thesupport of his mind, and for that, of course, plain talk was imperative. Aslong as possible, however, I postponed this little climax, and tried toignore or laugh at the occasional sentences he flung into the emptiness.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][RELIEF][CONFLICT]Some of these sentences, moreover, were confoundedly disquieting to me,coming as they did to corroborate much that I felt myself; corroboration,too--which made it so much more convincing--from a totally different pointof view. He composed such curious sentences, and hurled them at me in suchan inconsequential sort of way, as though his main line of thought wassecret to himself, and these fragments were mere bits he found itimpossible to digest. He got rid of them by uttering them. Speech relievedhim. It was like being sick.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][DANGER][PROBLEM][METAPHOR][PERSPECTIVE][DIALOGUE]"There are things about us, I'm sure, that make for disorder,disintegration, destruction, our destruction," he said once, while the fireblazed between us. [DIALOGUE]"We've strayed out of a safe line somewhere."And, another time, when the gong sounds had come nearer, ringing muchlouder than before, and directly over our heads, he said as though talkingto himself:[DIALOGUE]"I don't think a gramophone would show any record of that. The sounddoesn't come to me by the ears at all. The vibrations reach me in anothermanner altogether, and seem to be within me, which is precisely how afourth dimensional sound might be supposed to make itself heard."I purposely made no reply to this, but I sat up a little closer to the fireand peered about me into the darkness. The clouds were massed all over thesky, and no trace of moonlight came through. Very still, too, everythingwas, so that the river and the frogs had things all their own way.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][RELIEF][SURPRISE][DIALOGUE]"It has that about it," he went on, [DIALOGUE]"which is utterly out of commonexperience. It is unknown. Only one thing describes it really; it is anon-human sound; I mean a sound outside humanity."Having rid himself of this indigestible morsel, he lay quiet for a time,but he had so admirably expressed my own feeling that it was a relief tohave the thought out, and to have confined it by the limitation of wordsfrom dangerous wandering to and fro in the mind.The solitude of that Danube camping-place, can I ever forget it? Thefeeling of being utterly alone on an empty planet! My thoughts ranincessantly upon cities and the haunts of men. I would have given my soul,
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][EMOTION][METAPHOR][PERSPECTIVE][DANGER][CONTEXT][PROBLEM][HORROR]as the saying is, for the [DIALOGUE]"feel" of those Bavarian villages we had passedthrough by the score; for the normal, human commonplaces; peasants drinkingbeer, tables beneath the trees, hot sunshine, and a ruined castle on therocks behind the red-roofed church. Even the tourists would have beenwelcome.Yet what I felt of dread was no ordinary ghostly fear. It was infinitelygreater, stranger, and seemed to arise from some dim ancestral sense ofterror more profoundly disturbing than anything I had known or dreamed of.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][DANGER][METAPHOR][PROBLEM][CONTEXT][SURPRISE][CHARACTERIZATION][PERSPECTIVE][CONFLICT]We had [DIALOGUE]"strayed," as the Swede put it, into some region or some set ofconditions where the risks were great, yet unintelligible to us; where thefrontiers of some unknown world lay close about us. It was a spot held bythe dwellers in some outer space, a sort of peep-hole whence they could spyupon the earth, themselves unseen, a point where the veil between had worna little thin. As the final result of too long a sojourn here, we should becarried over the border and deprived of what we called [DIALOGUE]"our lives," yet bymental, not physical, processes. In that sense, as he said, we should bethe victims of our adventure--a sacrifice.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][METAPHOR]It took us in different fashion, each according to the measure of hissensitiveness and powers of resistance. I translated it vaguely into apersonification of the mightily disturbed elements, investing them with thehorror of a deliberate and malefic purpose, resentful of our audaciousintrusion into their breeding-place; whereas my friend threw it into theunoriginal form at first of a trespass on some ancient shrine, some placewhere the old gods still held sway, where the emotional forces of formerworshippers still clung, and the ancestral portion of him yielded to theold pagan spell.At any rate, here was a place unpolluted by men, kept clean by the windsfrom coarsening human influences, a place where spiritual agencies werewithin reach and aggressive. Never, before or since, have I been soattacked by indescribable suggestions of a [DIALOGUE]"beyond region," of anotherscheme of life, another revolution not parallel to the human. And in the
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][EXPOSITION]end our minds would succumb under the weight of the awful spell, and weshould be drawn across the frontier into their world.Small things testified to the amazing influence of the place, and now inthe silence round the fire they allowed themselves to be noted by the mind.The very atmosphere had proved itself a magnifying medium to distort everyindication: the otter rolling in the current, the hurrying boatman makingsigns, the shifting willows, one and all had been robbed of its naturalcharacter, and revealed in something of its other aspect--as it existedacross the border to that other region. And this changed aspect I felt wasnow not merely to me, but to the race. The whole experience whose verge we
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE]touched was unknown to humanity at all. It was a new order of experience,and in the true sense of the word unearthly.[DIALOGUE]"It's the deliberate, calculating purpose that reduces one's courage tozero," the Swede said suddenly, as if he had been actually following mythoughts. [DIALOGUE]"Otherwise imagination might count for much. But the paddle, thecanoe, the lessening food--"[DIALOGUE]"Haven't I explained all that once?" I interrupted viciously.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][SURPRISE][DIALOGUE]"You have," he answered dryly; [DIALOGUE]"you have indeed."He made other remarks too, as usual, about what he called the [DIALOGUE]"plaindetermination to provide a victim"; but, having now arranged my thoughtsbetter, I recognized that this was simply the cry of his frightened soulagainst the knowledge that he was being attacked in a vital part, and thathe would be somehow taken or destroyed. The situation called for a courageand calmness of reasoning that neither of us could compass, and I havenever before been so clearly conscious of two persons in me--the one thatexplained everything, and the other that laughed at such foolishexplanations, yet was horribly afraid.Meanwhile, in the pitchy night the fire died down and the wood pile grewsmall. Neither of us moved to replenish the stock, and the darknessconsequently came up very close to our faces. A few feet beyond the circle
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]of firelight it was inky black. Occasionally a stray puff of wind set thewillows shivering about us, but apart from this not very welcome sound adeep and depressing silence reigned, broken only by the gurgling of theriver and the humming in the air overhead.We both missed, I think, the shouting company of the winds.At length, at a moment when a stray puff prolonged itself as though thewind were about to rise again, I reached the point for me of saturation,the point where it was absolutely necessary to find relief in plain speech,or else to betray myself by some hysterical extravagance that must havebeen far worse in its effect upon both of us. I kicked the fire into a
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][EMOTION][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][PERSPECTIVE]blaze, and turned to my companion abruptly. He looked up with a start.[DIALOGUE]"I can't disguise it any longer," I said; "I don't like this place, and thedarkness, and the noises, and the awful feelings I get. There's somethinghere that beats me utterly. I'm in a blue funk, and that's the plain truth.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][CONFLICT]If the other shore was--different, I swear I'd be inclined to swim for it!"The Swede's face turned very white beneath the deep tan of sun and wind. Hestared straight at me and answered quietly, but his voice betrayed his hugeexcitement by its unnatural calmness. For the moment, at any rate, he wasthe strong man of the two. He was more phlegmatic, for one thing.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][DIALOGUE]"It's not a physical condition we can escape from by running away," hereplied, in the tone of a doctor diagnosing some grave disease; [DIALOGUE]"we mustsit tight and wait. There are forces close here that could kill a herd ofelephants in a second as easily as you or I could squash a fly. Our onlychance is to keep perfectly still. Our insignificance perhaps may save us."I put a dozen questions into my expression of face, but found no words. Itwas precisely like listening to an accurate description of a disease whosesymptoms had puzzled me.[DIALOGUE]"I mean that so far, although aware of our disturbing presence, they havenot found us--not 'located' us, as the Americans say," he went on. "They'reblundering about like men hunting for a leak of gas. The paddle and canoeand provisions prove that. I think they feel us, but cannot actually see
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][DANGER][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][EMOTION][PERSPECTIVE][HORROR]us. We must keep our minds quiet--it's our minds they feel. We must controlour thoughts, or it's all up with us.[DIALOGUE]""Death, you mean?" I stammered, icy with the horror of his suggestion.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][DIALOGUE]"Worse--by far," he said. "Death, according to one's belief, means eitherannihilation or release from the limitations of the senses, but it involvesno change of character. You don't suddenly alter just because the body'sgone. But this means a radical alteration, a complete change, a horribleloss of oneself by substitution--far worse than death, and not evenannihilation. We happen to have camped in a spot where their region touches
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][HORROR]ours, where the veil between has worn thin[DIALOGUE]"--horrors! he was using my veryown phrase, my actual words--"so that they are aware of our being in theirneighborhood.[DIALOGUE]""But who are aware?" I asked.I forgot the shaking of the willows in the windless calm, the hummingoverhead, everything except that I was waiting for an answer that I dreadedmore than I can possibly explain.He lowered his voice at once to reply, leaning forward a little over thefire, an indefinable change in his face that made me avoid his eyes andlook down upon the ground.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][DIALOGUE]"All my life," he said, [DIALOGUE]"I have been strangely, vividly conscious ofanother region--not far removed from our own world in one sense, yet whollydifferent in kind--where great things go on unceasingly, where immense andterrible personalities hurry by, intent on vast purposes compared to whichearthly affairs, the rise and fall of nations, the destinies of empires,the fate of armies and continents, are all as dust in the balance; vastpurposes, I mean, that deal directly with the soul, and not indirectly withmore expressions of the soul--"[DIALOGUE]"I suggest just now--" I began, seeking to stop him, feeling as though Iwas face to face with a madman. But he instantly overbore me with historrent that had to come.[DIALOGUE]"You think," he said, [DIALOGUE]"it is the spirit of the elements, and I thoughtperhaps it was the old gods. But I tell you now it is--neither. These wouldbe comprehensible entities, for they have relations with men, dependingupon them for worship or sacrifice, whereas these beings who are now aboutus have absolutely nothing to do with mankind, and it is mere chance thattheir space happens just at this spot to touch our own."The mere conception, which his words somehow made so convincing, as Ilistened to them there in the dark stillness of that lonely island, set meshaking a little all over. I found it impossible to control my movements.[DIALOGUE]"And what do you propose?" I began again.[DIALOGUE]"A sacrifice, a victim, might save us by distracting them until we couldget away," he went on, [DIALOGUE]"just as the wolves stop to devour the dogs and givethe sleigh another start. But--I see no chance of any other victim now."I stared blankly at him. The gleam in his eye was dreadful. Presently hecontinued.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]IV[DIALOGUE]"It's the willows, of course. The willows mask the others, but the othersare feeling about for us. If we let our minds betray our fear, we're lost,lost utterly." He looked at me with an expression so calm, so determined,so sincere, that I no longer had any doubts as to his sanity. He was assane as any man ever was. [DIALOGUE]"If we can hold out through the night," he added,[DIALOGUE]"we may get off in the daylight unnoticed, or rather, undiscovered."[DIALOGUE]"But you really think a sacrifice would--"That gong-like humming came down very close over our heads as I spoke, butit was my friend's scared face that really stopped my mouth.[DIALOGUE]"Hush!" he whispered, holding up his hand. "Do not mention them more than
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][METAPHOR][EXPOSITION][CHARACTERIZATION][DANGER][PROBLEM]you can help. Do not refer to them by name. To name is to reveal; it is theinevitable clue, and our only hope lies in ignoring them, in order thatthey may ignore us.[DIALOGUE]""Even in thought?" He was extraordinarily agitated.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][DIALOGUE]"Especially in thought. Our thoughts make spirals in their world. We mustkeep them out of our minds at all costs if possible."I raked the fire together to prevent the darkness having everything its ownway. I never longed for the sun as I longed for it then in the awfulblackness of that summer night.[DIALOGUE]"Were you awake all last night?" he went on suddenly.[DIALOGUE]"I slept badly a little after dawn," I replied evasively, trying to followhis instructions, which I knew instinctively were true, [DIALOGUE]"but the wind, ofcourse--"[DIALOGUE]"I know. But the wind won't account for all the noises."[DIALOGUE]"Then you heard it too?"[DIALOGUE]"The multiplying countless little footsteps I heard," he said, adding,after a moment's hesitation, [DIALOGUE]"and that other sound--"[DIALOGUE]"You mean above the tent, and the pressing down upon us of somethingtremendous, gigantic?"He nodded significantly.[DIALOGUE]"It was like the beginning of a sort of inner suffocation?" I said.[DIALOGUE]"Partly, yes. It seemed to me that the weight of the atmosphere had beenaltered--had increased enormously, so that we should have been crushed."[DIALOGUE]"And that," I went on, determined to have it all out, pointing upwardswhere the gong-like note hummed ceaselessly, rising and falling like wind.[DIALOGUE]"What do you make of that?"[DIALOGUE]"It's their sound," he whispered gravely. "It's the sound of their world,the humming in their region. The division here is so thin that it leaksthrough somehow. But, if you listen carefully, you'll find it's not above
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][PROBLEM][CHARACTERIZATION][DANGER][SURPRISE][CONTEXT][PERSPECTIVE]so much as around us. It's in the willows. It's the willows themselveshumming, because here the willows have been made symbols of the forces thatare against us."I could not follow exactly what he meant by this, yet the thought and ideain my mind were beyond question the thought and idea in his. I realized
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE]what he realized, only with less power of analysis than his. It was on thetip of my tongue to tell him at last about my hallucination of theascending figures and the moving bushes, when he suddenly thrust his faceagain close into mine across the firelight and began to speak in a veryearnest whisper. He amazed me by his calmness and pluck, his apparentcontrol of the situation. This man I had for years deemed unimaginative,stolid!
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][DIALOGUE]"Now listen," he said. [DIALOGUE]"The only thing for us to do is to go on as thoughnothing had happened, follow our usual habits, go to bed, and so forth;pretend we feel nothing and notice nothing. It is a question wholly of themind, and the less we think about them the better our chance of escape.Above all, don't think, for what you think happens!"[DIALOGUE]"All right," I managed to reply, simply breathless with his words and thestrangeness of it all; [DIALOGUE]"all right, I'll try, but tell me one more thingfirst. Tell me what you make of those hollows in the ground all about us,those sand-funnels?"[DIALOGUE]"No!" he cried, forgetting to whisper in his excitement. "I dare not,simply dare not, put the thought into words. If you have not guessed I amglad. Don't try to. They have put it into my mind; try your hardest to
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][HORROR]prevent their putting it into yours."He sank his voice again to a whisper before he finished, and I did notpress him to explain. There was already just about as much horror in me asI could hold. The conversation came to an end, and we smoked our pipesbusily in silence.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][PERSPECTIVE][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE][TRANSITION]Then something happened, something unimportant apparently, as the way iswhen the nerves are in a very great state of tension, and this small thingfor a brief space gave me an entirely different point of view. I chanced tolook down at my sand-shoe--the sort we used for the canoe--and something todo with the hole at the toe suddenly recalled to me the London shop where Ihad bought them, the difficulty the man had in fitting me, and otherdetails of the uninteresting but practical operation. At once, in itstrain, followed a wholesome view of the modern skeptical world I wasaccustomed to move in at home. I thought of roast beef, and ale,motor-cars, policemen, brass bands, and a dozen other things thatproclaimed the soul of ordinariness or utility. The effect was immediate
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][EMOTION][METAPHOR]and astonishing even to myself. Psychologically, I suppose, it was simply asudden and violent reaction after the strain of living in an atmosphere ofthings that to the normal consciousness must seem impossible andincredible. But, whatever the cause, it momentarily lifted the spell frommy heart, and left me for the short space of a minute feeling free andutterly unafraid. I looked up at my friend opposite.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][CONFLICT][EMOTION][DANGER][HORROR][DIALOGUE]"You damned old pagan!" I cried, laughing aloud in his face. [DIALOGUE]"Youimaginative idiot! You superstitious idolater! You--"I stopped in the middle, seized anew by the old horror. I tried to smother
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][PROBLEM][METAPHOR][HORROR]the sound of my voice as something sacrilegious. The Swede, of course,heard it too--the strange cry overhead in the darkness--and that suddendrop in the air as though something had come nearer.He had turned ashen white under the tan. He stood bolt upright in front ofthe fire, stiff as a rod, staring at me.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][CONFLICT][DIALOGUE]"After that," he said in a sort of helpless, frantic way, [DIALOGUE]"we must go! Wecan't stay now; we must strike camp this very instant and go on--down theriver."He was talking, I saw, quite wildly, his words dictated by abjectterror--the terror he had resisted so long, but which had caught him atlast.[DIALOGUE]"In the dark?" I exclaimed, shaking with fear after my hysterical outburst,but still realizing our position better than he did. "Sheer madness! Theriver's in flood, and we've only got a single paddle. Besides, we only godeeper into their country! There's nothing ahead for fifty miles but
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK][CONFLICT]willows, willows, willows!"He sat down again in a state of semi-collapse. The positions, by one ofthose kaleidoscopic changes nature loves, were suddenly reversed, and thecontrol of our forces passed over into my hands. His mind at last hadreached the point where it was beginning to weaken.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][DANGER][HORROR][DIALOGUE]"What on earth possessed you to do such a thing?" he whispered with the aweof genuine terror in his voice and face.I crossed round to his side of the fire. I took both his hands in mine,kneeling down beside him and looking straight into his frightened eyes.[DIALOGUE]"We'll make one more blaze," I said firmly, "and then turn in for thenight. At sunrise we'll be off full speed for Komorn. Now, pull yourself
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][RELIEF][TRANSITION]together a bit, and remember your own advice about not thinking fear!"He said no more, and I saw that he would agree and obey. In some measure,too, it was a sort of relief to get up and make an excursion into thedarkness for more wood. We kept close together, almost touching, gropingamong the bushes and along the bank. The humming overhead never ceased, but
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][CONFLICT][EMOTION][ACTION][DANGER][SURPRISE]seemed to me to grow louder as we increased our distance from the fire. Itwas shivery work!We were grubbing away in the middle of a thickish clump of willows wheresome driftwood from a former flood had caught high among the branches, whenmy body was seized in a grip that made me half drop upon the sand. It wasthe Swede. He had fallen against me, and was clutching me for support. I
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][DANGER][EMOTION][FLASHBACK][PROBLEM][CONTEXT][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][HORROR]heard his breath coming and going in short gasps.[DIALOGUE]"Look! By my soul!" he whispered, and for the first time in my experience Iknew what it was to hear tears of terror in a human voice. He was pointingto the fire, some fifty feet away. I followed the direction of his finger,and I swear my heart missed a beat.There, in front of the dim glow, something was moving.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][METAPHOR][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][HORROR]I saw it through a veil that hung before my eyes like the gauzedrop-curtain used at the back of a theater--hazily a little. It was neithera human figure nor an animal. To me it gave the strange impression of beingas large as several animals grouped together, like horses, two or three,moving slowly. The Swede, too, got a similar result, though expressing itdifferently, for he thought it was shaped and sized like a clump of willowbushes, rounded at the top, and moving all over upon its surface--[DIALOGUE]"coilingupon itself like smoke," he said afterwards.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][EMOTION][DANGER][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][HORROR][DIALOGUE]"I watched it settle downwards through the bushes," he sobbed at me. [DIALOGUE]"Look,by God! It's coming this way! Oh, oh!"--he gave a kind of whistling cry.[DIALOGUE]"They've found us."I gave one terrified glance, which just enabled me to see that the shadowyform was swinging towards us through the bushes, and then I collapsedbackwards with a crash into the branches. These failed, of course, tosupport my weight, so that with the Swede on top of me we fell in astruggling heap upon the sand. I really hardly knew what was happening. I
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][EMOTION][DANGER][CONFLICT]was conscious only of a sort of enveloping sensation of icy fear thatplucked the nerves out of their fleshly covering, twisted them this way andthat, and replaced them quivering. My eyes were tightly shut; something inmy throat choked me; a feeling that my consciousness was expanding,extending out into space, swiftly gave way to another feeling that I waslosing it altogether, and about to die.An acute spasm of pain passed through me, and I was aware that the Swedehad hold of me in such a way that he hurt me abominably. It was the way hecaught at me in falling.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][FLASHBACK][EMOTION][CONFLICT]But it was the pain, he declared afterwards, that saved me; it caused me toforget them and think of something else at the very instant when they wereabout to find me. It concealed my mind from them at the moment ofdiscovery, yet just in time to evade their terrible seizing of me. Hehimself, he says, actually swooned at the same moment, and that was whatsaved him.I only know that at a later date, how long or short is impossible to say, Ifound myself scrambling up out of the slippery network of willow branches,and saw my companion standing in front of me holding out a hand to assistme. I stared at him in a dazed way, rubbing the arm he had twisted for me.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][TRANSITION][FLASHBACK]Nothing came to me to say, somehow.[DIALOGUE]"I lost consciousness for a moment or two," I heard him say. [DIALOGUE]"That's whatsaved me. It made me stop thinking about them."[DIALOGUE]"You nearly broke my arm in two," I said, uttering my only connectedthought at the moment. A numbness came over me.[DIALOGUE]"That's what saved you!" he replied. "Between us, we've managed to set themoff on a false tack somewhere. The humming has ceased. It's gone--for the
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][RELIEF][EMOTION][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE]moment at any rate!"A wave of hysterical laughter seized me again, and this time spread to myfriend too--great healing gusts of shaking laughter that brought atremendous sense of relief in their train. We made our way back to the fireand put the wood on so that it blazed at once. Then we saw that the tenthad fallen over and lay in a tangled heap upon the ground.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]We picked it up, and during the process tripped more than once and caughtour feet in sand.[DIALOGUE]"It's those sand-funnels," exclaimed the Swede, when the tent was up againand the firelight lit up the ground for several yards about us. [DIALOGUE]"And lookat the size of them!"All round the tent and about the fireplace where we had seen the movingshadows there were deep funnel-shaped hollows in the sand, exactly similarto the ones we had already found over the island, only far bigger anddeeper, beautifully formed, and wide enough in some instances to admit thewhole of my foot and leg.Neither of us said a word. We both knew that sleep was the safest thing wecould do, and to bed we went accordingly without further delay, havingfirst thrown sand on the fire and taken the provision sack and the paddleinside the tent with us. The canoe, too, we propped in such a way at the
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][TRANSITION][EMOTION][CONFLICT][SURPRISE]end of the tent that our feet touched it, and the least motion woulddisturb and wake us.In case of emergency, too, we again went to bed in our clothes, ready for asudden start.It was my firm intention to lie awake all night and watch, but theexhaustion of nerves and body decreed otherwise, and sleep after a whilecame over me with a welcome blanket of oblivion. The fact that my companionalso slept quickened its approach. At first he fidgeted and constantly sat
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][FLASHBACK]up, asking me if I [DIALOGUE]"heard this" or [DIALOGUE]"heard that." He tossed about on hiscork mattress, and said the tent was moving and the river had risen overthe point of the island, but each time I went out to look I returned withthe report that all was well, and finally he grew calmer and lay still.Then at length his breathing became regular and I heard unmistakable soundsof snoring--the first and only time in my life when snoring has been awelcome and calming influence.This, I remember, was the last thought in my mind before dozing off.A difficulty in breathing woke me, and I found the blanket over my face.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK][HORROR]But something else besides the blanket was pressing upon me, and my firstthought was that my companion had rolled off his mattress on to my own inhis sleep. I called to him and sat up, and at the same moment it came to methat the tent was surrounded. That sound of multitudinous soft patteringwas again audible outside, filling the night with horror.I called again to him, louder than before. He did not answer, but I missed
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][DANGER][CONFLICT][FLASHBACK][CLIMAX][PERSPECTIVE][HELL]the sound of his snoring, and also noticed that the flap of the tent wasdown. This was the unpardonable sin. I crawled out in the darkness to hookit back securely, and it was then for the first time I realized positivelythat the Swede was not here. He had gone.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][EMOTION][ACTION][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][DANGER][FLASHBACK][PROBLEM]I dashed out in a mad run, seized by a dreadful agitation, and the moment Iwas out I plunged into a sort of torrent of humming that surrounded mecompletely and came out of every quarter of the heavens at once. It wasthat same familiar humming--gone mad! A swarm of great invisible bees mighthave been about me in the air. The sound seemed to thicken the veryatmosphere, and I felt that my lungs worked with difficulty.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][EMOTION][DANGER][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][ACTION][TRANSITION]But my friend was in danger, and I could not hesitate.The dawn was just about to break, and a faint whitish light spread upwardsover the clouds from a thin strip of clear horizon. No wind stirred. Icould just make out the bushes and river beyond, and the pale sandypatches. In my excitement I ran frantically to and fro about the island,
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE]calling him by name, shouting at the top of my voice the first words thatcame into my head. But the willows smothered my voice, and the hummingmuffled it, so that the sound only traveled a few feet round me. I plungedamong the bushes, tripping headlong, tumbling over roots, and scraping myface as I tore this way and that among the preventing branches.Then, quite unexpectedly, I came out upon the island's point and saw a darkfigure outlined between the water and the sky. It was the Swede. And
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][HORROR]already he had one foot in the river! A moment more and he would have takenthe plunge.I threw myself upon him, flinging my arms about his waist and dragging himshorewards with all my strength. Of course he struggled furiously, making anoise all the time just like that cursed humming, and using the mostoutlandish phrases in his anger about [DIALOGUE]"going inside to Them," and [DIALOGUE]"takingthe way of the water and the wind," and God only knows what more besides,that I tried in vain to recall afterwards, but which turned me sick withhorror and amazement as I listened. But in the end I managed to get him
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][EMOTION][METAPHOR][HORROR]into the comparative safety of the tent, and flung him breathless andcursing upon the mattress where I held him until the fit had passed.I think the suddenness with which it all went and he grew calm, coincidingas it did with the equally abrupt cessation of the humming and patteringoutside--I think this was almost the strangest part of the whole businessperhaps. For he had just opened his eyes and turned his tired face up to meso that the dawn threw a pale light upon it through the doorway, and said,for all the world just like a frightened child:"My life, old man--it's my life I owe you. But it's all over now anyhow.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]They've found a victim in our place!"Then he dropped back upon his blankets and went to sleep literally under myeyes. He simply collapsed, and began to snore again as healthily as thoughnothing had happened and he had never tried to offer his own life as asacrifice by drowning. And when the sunlight woke him three hourslater--hours of ceaseless vigil for me--it became so clear to me that heremembered absolutely nothing of what he had attempted to do, that I deemedit wise to hold my peace and ask no dangerous questions.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]He woke naturally and easily, as I have said, when the sun was already highin a windless hot sky, and he at once got up and set about the preparationof the fire for breakfast. I followed him anxiously at bathing, but he didnot attempt to plunge in, merely dipping his head and making some remarkabout the extra coldness of the water.[DIALOGUE]"River's falling at last," he said, [DIALOGUE]"and I'm glad of it."[DIALOGUE]"The humming has stopped too," I said.He looked up at me quietly with his normal expression. Evidently heremembered everything except his own attempt at suicide.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][DIALOGUE]"Everything has stopped," he said, [DIALOGUE]"because--"He hesitated. But I knew some reference to that remark he had made justbefore he fainted was in his mind, and I was determined to know it.[DIALOGUE]"Because 'They've found another victim'?" I said, forcing a little laugh.[DIALOGUE]"Exactly," he answered, [DIALOGUE]"exactly! I feel as positive of it as though--asthough--I feel quite safe again, I mean," he finished.He began to look curiously about him. The sunlight lay in hot patches onthe sand. There was no wind. The willows were motionless. He slowly rose to
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][DANGER][HORROR]feet.[DIALOGUE]"Come," he said; [DIALOGUE]"I think if we look, we shall find it."He started off on a run, and I followed him. He kept to the banks, pokingwith a stick among the sandy bays and caves and little back-waters, myselfalways close on his heels.[DIALOGUE]"Ah!" he exclaimed presently, [DIALOGUE]"ah!"The tone of his voice somehow brought back to me a vivid sense of thehorror of the last twenty-four hours, and I hurried up to join him. He waspointing with his stick at a large black object that lay half in the waterand half on the sand. It appeared to be caught by some twisted willow rootsso that the river could not sweep it away. A few hours before the spot must
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][DANGER][MURDER]have been under water.[DIALOGUE]"See," he said quietly, [DIALOGUE]"the victim that made our escape possible!"And when I peered across his shoulder I saw that his stick rested on thebody of a man. He turned it over. It was the corpse of a peasant, and theface was hidden in the sand. Clearly the man had been drowned, but a fewhours before, and his body must have been swept down upon our islandsomewhere about the hour of the dawn--at the very time the fit had passed.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][EMOTION][CHARACTER][PERSPECTIVE][DANGER][MURDER][DIALOGUE]"We must give it a decent burial, you know."[DIALOGUE]"I suppose so," I replied. I shuddered a little in spite of myself, forthere was something about the appearance of that poor drowned man thatturned me cold.The Swede glanced up sharply at me, an undecipherable expression on hisface, and began clambering down the bank. I followed him more leisurely.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][CONFLICT][ACTION][PROBLEM][DANGER][TRANSITION]The current, I noticed, had torn away much of the clothing from the body,so that the neck and part of the chest lay bare.Halfway down the bank my companion suddenly stopped and held up his hand inwarning; but either my foot slipped, or I had gained too much momentum tobring myself quickly to a halt, for I bumped into him and sent him forwardwith a sort of leap to save himself. We tumbled together on to the hardsand so that our feet splashed into the water. And, before anything couldbe done, we had collided a little heavily against the corpse.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][EMOTION][SURPRISE][DANGER]The Swede uttered a sharp cry. And I sprang back as if I had been shot.At the moment we touched the body there rose from its surface the loudsound of humming--the sound of several hummings--which passed with a vastcommotion as of winged things in the air about us and disappeared upwardsinto the sky, growing fainter and fainter till they finally ceased in thedistance. It was exactly as though we had disturbed some living yetinvisible creatures at work.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][ACTION][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][DEATH]My companion clutched me, and I think I clutched him, but before either ofus had time properly to recover from the unexpected shock, we saw that amovement of the current was turning the corpse round so that it becamereleased from the grip of the willow roots. A moment later it had turnedcompletely over, the dead face uppermost, staring at the sky. It lay on theedge of the main stream. In another moment it would be swept away.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]The Swede started to save it, shouting again something I did not catchabout a [DIALOGUE]"proper burial"--and then abruptly dropped upon his knees on thesand and covered his eyes with his hands. I was beside him in an instant.I saw what he had seen.For just as the body swung round to the current the face and the exposedchest turned full towards us, and showed plainly how the skin and fleshwere indented with small hollows, beautifully formed, and exactly similarin shape and kind to the sand-funnels that we had found all over theisland.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][DIALOGUE]"Their mark!" I heard my companion mutter under his breath. [DIALOGUE]"Their awfulmark!"And when I turned my eyes again from his ghastly face to the river, thecurrent had done its work, and the body had been swept away into mid-streamand was already beyond our reach and almost out of sight, turning over andover on the waves like an otter.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Willows, by Algernon Blackwood*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE WILLOWS ******** This file should be named 11438.txt or 11438.zip *****

[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]Literary Archive FoundationProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission ofincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can befreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widestarray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exemptstatus with the IRS.The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulatingcharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the UnitedStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes aconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep upwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  ToSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for anyparticular state visit http://pglaf.orgWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where wehave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibitionagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states whoapproach us with offers to donate.International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot makeany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received fromoutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]works.Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tmconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely sharedwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed ProjectGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printededitions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarilykeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD][TRANSITION]Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook'seBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,compressed (zipped), HTML and others.Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take overthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receivingnew filenames and etext numbers.

[ALGERNON BLACKWOOD]of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which isidentical to the filename).
