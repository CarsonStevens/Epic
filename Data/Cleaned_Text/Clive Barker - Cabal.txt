There'd been a time notall that long ago when he'd felt the burden of his mental anguishlifting. There'd been fewer psychotic episodes, fewer days when hefelt like slitting his wrists rather than enduring the hours till hisnext medication. There'd seemed to be a chance for happiness.
It was that prospect that had won the declaration of love from him;that: I'll never leave you," whispered in Lori's ear as they lay in thenarrow bed he'd never dared hope would hold two. The words had notcome in the throes of high passion. Their love life, like so much elsebetween them, was fraught with problems. But where other women hadgiven up on him, unforgiving of his failure, she'd persevered: told himthere was plenty of time to get it right, all the time in the world.I'm with you for as long as you want me to be, patience had seemed tosay.
[EMOTION][CONFLICT][FLASHBACK][DANGER][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][PERSPECTIVE][CONTEXT][HORROR]Nobody had ever offered such a commitment; he wanted to offer one inreturn. Those words: never leave you'. Were it.The memory of them, and of her skin almost luminous in the murk of hisroom, and of the sound of breathing when she finally fell asleep besidehim; of it still had the power to catch his heart, and squeez it tillit hurt.
[CONFLICT][DANGER]He longed to be free of both the memory and words, now thatcircumstance had taken any hope their fulfilment out of his hands. Butthey wouldn't be forgotten. They lingered on to torment him withfrailty. His meagre comfort was that she know what she must now knowabout him, would working to erase her memory; and that with time she'isucceed. He only hoped she'd understand his ignoranc of himself when
[PERSPECTIVE][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][DANGER][ACTION][PROBLEM][WEAPON][METAPHOR][RESOLUTION][EMOTION][CONTEXT][FLASHBACK]he'd voiced that promise. He'd neverj have risked this pain if he'ddoubted health was finally! within his grasp.Dream on!
[SURPRISE][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][DANGER]Decker had brought an abrupt end to those delusions! the day he'dlocked the office door, drawn the blinds J on the Alberta springsunshine, and said, in a voice| barely louder than a whisper:[DIALOGUE]"Boone.I think we're in terrible trouble, you and I."He was trembling, Boone saw, a fact not easily! concealed in a body sobig. Decker had the physique of I a man who sweated out the day'sangst in a gym. Even his tailored suits, always charcoal, couldn't
tame his bulk. It had made Boone edgy at the start of their worktogether, he felt intimidated by the doctor's physical and mentalauthority. Now it was the fallibility of that strength he feared.Decker was a Rock; he was Reason; he was Calm. This anxiety ran
[SURPRISE][CONFLICT]counter to all he knew about the man.[DIALOGUE]"What's wrong?"Boone asked.[DIALOGUE]"Sit, will you?Sit and I'll tell you."Boone did as he was told. In this office, Decker was lord. The doctorleaned back in the leather chair and inhaled through his nose, hismouth sealed in a downward curve.
[CONFLICT][DIALOGUE]"Tell me ..."Boone said.[DIALOGUE]"Where to start."[DIALOGUE]"Anywhere."[DIALOGUE]"I thought you were getting better," Decker said.both did.[DIALOGUE]""I really did.We"I still am Boone said.
Decker made a small shake of his head. He was a man of considerableintellect, but little of it showed on his tightly packed features,except perhaps in his eyes, which at the moment were not watching thepatient, but the table between them.[DIALOGUE]"You've started to talk in your sessions," Decker said, 'about crimesyou think you've committed. Do you remember any of that?[DIALOGUE]""You know I don't.[DIALOGUE]" The trances Decker put him in were too profound:"I only remember when you play the tape back.[DIALOGUE]"I won't be playing any of these," Decker said.

You talk about them obsessively. At first I thought theywere dream crimes. You always had a violent streak in you."
[SURPRISE][DANGER][DIALOGUE]"And now?"[DIALOGUE]"Now I'm afraid you may have actually committed them."There was a long silence, while Boone studiedDecker, more in puzzlement than anger. The blinds had not been pulledall the way down. A slice of sunlight fell across him, and on to thetable between them. On the glass surface was a bottle, of still water,two tumblers, and a large envelope. Decker leaned forward and picked
[PROBLEM][SURPRISE][DANGER][MURDER]it up.[DIALOGUE]"What I'm doing now is probably a crime in itself," he told Boone."Patient confidentiality is one thing; protecting a killer is another.But part of me is still hoping to God it isn't true. I want to believeI've succeeded. We've succeeded. Together. I want to believe you're

Hiswarning had been well advised. The picture on the top of the pile waslike a physical assault. Faced with it a fear rose in him he'd not
[DANGER][DEATH][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][MURDER]felt since being in Decker's care: that the image might possess him.He'd built walls against that superstition, brick by brick, but theyshook now, and threatened to fall.[DIALOGUE]"It's just a picture."That's right,[DIALOGUE]" Decker replied.see?"[DIALOGUE]"It's just a picture.What do you"A dead man.[DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE]""A murdered man.""Yes.A murdered man."Not simply murdered: butchered. The life slashed from him in a fury ofslices and stabs, his blood flung on the blade that had taken out hisneck, taken off his face, on to the wall behind him. He wore only his
[SURPRISE][DANGER][CONFLICT][HORROR]shorts, so the wounds on his body could be easily counted, despite theblood. Boone did just that now, to keep the horror from overcominghim. Even here, inthis room where the doctor had chiselled another self from the blockof his patient's condition, Boone had never choked on terror as hechoked now. He tasted his breakfast in the back of his throat, or themeal the night before, rising from' his bowels against nature. Shit in
[METAPHOR][PROBLEM][MURDER]his mouth, like the dirt of this deed.Count the wounds, he told himself; pretend they're beads on an abacus.Three, four, five in the abdomen and chest: one in particular ragged,more like a tear than a wound, gaping so wide the man's innards pokedout. On the shoulder, two more. And then the face, unmade with cuts.
[METAPHOR]So many their numbers could not be calculated, even by the mostdetached of observers. They left the victim beyond recognition: eyesdug out, lips slit off, nose in ribbons.[DIALOGUE]"Enough?"Decker said, as if the question needed asking.[DIALOGUE]"Yes."[DIALOGUE]"There's a lot more to see."He uncovered the second, laying the first beside the pile. This onewas of a woman, sprawled on a sofa, her upper body and her lowertwisted in a fashion life would have forbidden. Though she waspresumably not a relation of the first victim the butcher had created avile resemblance. Here was the same lipless ness the same eyeless ness

First, he knewthat Decker would not be endangering his patient's equilibrium this wayunless he had good reason for it. Second, denial was valueless when
[DANGER]both of them knew how easily Boone's mind had deceived itself in thepast. If he was responsible for these atrocities there was nocertainty he'd know it.Instead he kept his silence, not daring to look up at Decker for fearhe'd see the Rock shattered.[DIALOGUE]"Another?"Decker said.

[FLASHBACK][SURPRISE][CONFLICT]"he said.He heard Decker sigh, but there was no answer forthcoming, so hechanced a glance at his accuser. As the photographs had been laid outbefore him he'd felt the man's scrutiny like a crawling ache in hisscalp. But now he once more found that gaze averted.
[SURPRISE][CONFLICT][DANGER][DIALOGUE]"Please tell me he said."Did I do this?[DIALOGUE]"Decker wiped the moist purses of skin beneath his grey eyes.not trembling any longer.He was"I hope not," he said.

[DIALOGUE]"Tell me the words '"It was ramblings mostly.[DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE]""So what makes you think I'm responsible?You must have reasons.""It took time,[DIALOGUE]" Decker said, 'for me to piece the whole thingtogether."

[CONTEXT][FLASHBACK]Boone knew codes. He'd heard them everywhere during the bad times.Messages from the imagined enemy in the noise between stations on theradio; or in the murmur of traffic before dawn. That he might havelearned the art himself came as no surprise.

[DIALOGUE]"Please sit down and tell me what thesephotographs mean to you."Involuntarily Boone had put his hand over the lower half of his face.He knew from Decker's instruction what that particular piece of bodylanguage signified.

Despite the patient's insistencethat the crimes were his, Decker counselled caution. Admissions of
[CONTEXT][PROBLEM][PERSPECTIVE]culpability were not hard evidence. They had to be certain thatconfession wasn't simply Boone's self-destructive tendencies at work,admitting to the crime out of hunger for the punishment.Boone was in no position to argue. Decker knew him better than he knewhimself. Nor had he forgotten Decker's observation that if the worst
[MURDER]was proved true, the doctor's reputation as a healer would be thrown tothe dogs: they could neither of them afford to be wrong. The only wayto be sure was to run through the details of the killings dates, namesand locations in the hope that Boone would be prompted intoremembering. Or else that they'd discover a killing that had occurredwhen he was indisputably in the company of others.The only part of the process Boone balked at was reexamining thephotographs. He resisted Decker's gentle pressure for forty-eight
hours, only conceding when the gentility faltered and Decker rounded onhim, accusing him of cowardice and deceit.

[DANGER][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][EMOTION]in his own agonies he couldn't see how profoundly the man suffered. Buthe could do nothing to mitigate that hurt. He just watched the cloudspass, up there in the light, and knew there were only dark timesahead.[DIALOGUE]"When the police take you ..." Decker murmured, 'it won't just be youwho's alone, Boone.

When he asked for more they were supplied, andunder their soporific influenc they went back to the business of theevidence, as the doctor went over, and over again, the details ofBoone's crimes, in the hope of comprehending them. But nothing cameclear. All Boone's increasingly passive mind could recover from these
[CONFLICT][MURDER]sessions were slurred images of doors he'd slipped through and stairshe'd climbed in the performance of murder. He was less and less awareof Decker, still fighting to salvage something I worth from hispatient's closed mind. All Boone kne\ now was sleep, and guilt, andthe hope, increasinglyj cherished, of an end to both.Only Lori, or rather memories of her, pricked the drugs' regime. He
could hear her voice sometimes, in his inner ear, clear as a bell,repeating words she'd spoken to him in some casual conversation, whichhe was dredging up from the past. There was nothing of consequence inthese phrases; they were perhaps associated with a look he'd treasured,or a touch. Now he could remember neither look nor touch the drugs hadremoved so much of his capacity to imagine. All he was left with werethese dislocated lines, distressing him not simply because they werespoken as if by somebody at his shoulder, but because they had nocontext that he could recall. And worse than either, their sound
[PROBLEM][DANGER][FLASHBACK][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][CHARACTER][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][EMOTION][HELL]reminded him of the woman he'd loved and would not see again, unlessacross a courtroom. A woman to whom he had made a promise he'd brokenwithin weeks of his making it. In his wretchedness, his thoughtsbarely cogent, that broken promise was as monstrous as the crimes inthe photographs. It fitted him for Hell.
[METAPHOR][DANGER][DEATH][CONFLICT][HORROR]Or death. Better death. He was not entirely sure how long had passedsince he'd done the deal with Decker exchanging this stupor for a fewmore days of investigation, but he was certain he had kept his side ofthe bargain. He was talked out. There was nothing left to say, nor
[CONFLICT][MURDER]hear. All that remained was to take himself to the law, and confesshis crimes, or to do what the state no longer had the power to do, andkill the monster.He didn't dare alert Decker to this plan; he knew the doctor would doall in his power to prevent his patient's suicide. So he went onplaying the quiescent subject one day more. Then, promising Decker
he'd be at the office the following morning, he returned home andprepared to kill himself.There was another letter from Lori awaiting him, the fourth since he'dabsented himself, demanding to know what was wrong. He read it as besthis befuddled thoughts would allow, and attempted a reply, butcouldn't make sense of the words he was trying write. Instead,pocketing the appeal she'd sent to '. he went out into the dusk to look

But while his avowals of eternal love had proved hollow
in a matte of weeks, Midian made promises midnight, like his own,deepest midnight that even death could notj break.The RhapsodistIn the years of his illness, in and out of mental wards and hospices,Boone had met very few fellow sufferers who didn't cleave to sometalisman, some sign 01 keepsake to stand guard at the gates of theirheads and hearts. He'd learned quickly not to despise such charms.Whatever gets you through the night was an axiom he understood fromhard experience. Most of these safeguards against chaos were personalto those that wielded them. Trinkets, keys, books and photographs:
mementoes of good times treasured as defence against the bad. But somebelonged to the collective mind. They were words he would hear morethan once: nonsense rhymes whose rhythm kept the pain at bay; names ofGods. Amongst them, Midian.
He'd heard the name of that place spoken maybe half a dozen times bypeople he'd met on the way through, usually those whose strength wasall burned up. When they called on Midian it was as a place of refuge;a place to be carried away to. And more: a place where whatever sinsthey'd committed real or imagined would be forgiven them. Boone didn'tknow the origins f this mythology; nor had he ever been interestedenough to enquire. He had not been in need of forgiveness, or so he
thought. Now he knew better. He had Plenty to seek cleansing of;obscenities his mind had kept from him until Decker had brought them tolight, which no agency he knew could lift from him. He had Joinedanother class of creature.

There was no sound as the hooks, razor sharp, slit his skin, butblood began to flow instantly, down his neck and arms. The expressionon his face didn't change, it merely intensified: a mask in which comicmuse and tragic were united. Then, fingers spread to either side of
his face, he steadily drew therazor hooks down the line of his jaw. He had al geon's precision.

He wanted to see the man secret face: theWild One beneath the skin that ma def him fit for Midian's ease. Thered rain was dispersir The air began to clear. He saw the face now, alittlej but couldn't make sense of its complexity. Was that, beast's

AI moment more, and he'd know Then,someone had hold of him, seizing his arms; and dragging him towards thedoor. He glimpsed Narcisse raising the weapons of his hands to keephis saviours at bay, then the uniforms were upon him, and he waseclipsed. In the rush of the moment Boone took his chance. He pushed
the nurse from him, snatched up his leather jacket, and ran for theunguarded door. His bruised body was not prepared for violent action.He stumbled, nausea and darting pains in his bruised limbs vying forthe honour of bringing him to hisjoiees, but the sight of Narcisse surrounded and tethered was enoughto give him strength. He was away down the hall before anyone had achance to come after him.
As he headed for the door to the night he heard Narcisse's voice raisedin protest; a howl of rage that was pitifully human.NecropolisThough the distance from Calgary to Athabasca fas little more thanthree hundred miles the , jurney took a traveller to the borders ofanother world. North of here the highways were few, and theinhabitants fewer still, as the rich prairie lands of the provincesteadily gave way to forest, marshland and wilderness. It also markedthe limits of Boone's experience. A short stint as a truck driver, in
his early twenties, had taken him as far as Bonnyville to thesouth-east, Barrhead to the south-west and Athabasca itself. But theterritory beyond was unknown to him except as names on a map. Or morecorrectly, as an absence of names. There were great stretches of landhere that were dotted only with small farming settlements; one of whichbore the name Narcisse had used: Shere Neck.
[ACTION][TRANSITION][EMOTION][WEAPON][SURPRISE][DANGER]The map which carried this information he found, along with enoughchange to buy himself a bottle of brandy, in five minutes of theft onthe outskirts of Calgary. He rifled three vehicles left in anunderground parking facility and was away, mapped and monied, beforethe source of the car alarms had been traced by security.The rain washed his face, his bloodied tee-shirt he dumped, happy tohave his beloved jacket next to his skin. Then he found himself a rideto Edmonton, andanother which took him through Athabasca to Prairie.
[TRANSITION][ACTION][METAPHOR][SURPRISE]It was easy.Easy? To go in search of a place he'd only heard rumc of amongstlunatics? Perhaps not easy. But it necessary; even inevitable. From
[PERSPECTIVE][DEATH][SURPRISE]the moment the 1 he'd chosen to die beneath had cast him aside journeyhad been beckoning. Perhaps from long be that, only he'd never seenthe invitation. The sense I had of its Tightness might almost havemade a fat ali of him. If Midian existed, and was willing to em brachim, then he was travelling to a place where he would finally find someself-comprehension and peace. If j if it existed only as a talisman

Betterthat than the pills, better that Decker's fruitless pursuit of rhymesand reasons.The doctor's quest to root out the monster in Boon had been bound tofail. That much was clear as skies overhead. Boone the man and Boone
[MONSTER]the mon ste could not be divided. They were one, they travelle thesame road in the same mind and body. And ever lay at the end of thatroad, death or glory, would be the fate of both.East of Peace River, Narcisse had said, near the townf of Shere Neck;north of Dwyer.
He had to sleep rough in High Prairie, until the! following morningwhen he found a ride to Peace River, f The driver was a woman in herlate fifties, proud of the jregion she'd known since childhood and happy to give him a quickgeography lesson. He made no mention of Midian, but Dwyer and ShereNeck she knew the latter a town of five thousand souls away to the eastof Highway 67. He'd have saved himself a good two hundred miles ifhe'd not travelled as far as High Prairie, he was told, but takenhimself north earlier. No matter, she said; she knew a place in Peace
[TRANSITION][ACTION][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][CONTEXT]River where the farmers stopped off to eat before heading back to theirhomesteads. He'd find a ride there, to take him where he wanted to go.Got people there? she asked. He said he had.
[PROBLEM][DANGER]It was close to dusk by the time the last of his rides dropped him amile or so shy of Dwyer. He watched the truck take a gravel road offinto the deepening blue, then began to walk the short distance to thetown. A night of sleeping rough, and travelling in farm vehicles onroads that had seen better days, had taken its toll on his alreadybattered system. It took him an hour to come within sight of theoutskirts of Dwyer, by which time night had fallen completely. Fate
[FLASHBACK][DANGER][METAPHOR][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][CONFLICT]was once again on his side. Without the darkness he might not haveseen the lights flashing ahead; not in welcome but in warning.The police were here before him; three or four cars he judged. It waspossible they were in pursuit of someone else entirely but he doubtedit. More likely Narcisse, lost to himself, had told the law what he'd
[METAPHOR][PROBLEM][CONTEXT][CONFLICT][EXPOSITION][PERSPECTIVE][CHARACTERIZATION][TRANSITION]told Boone. In which case this was a reception committee. They wereprobably already searching for him, house to house. And if here, inShere Neck too. He was expected.
Thankful for the cover of the night, he made his way off the road andinto the middle of a rape seed field, where he could lie and thinkthrough his next move. There was certainly no wisdom in trying to gointoDwyer. Better he set off for Midian now, putting hunger and wearinessaside and trusting to the stj and his instinct to give himdirections.He got up, smelling of earth, and headednortherly direction. He knew v| well he

The air became cold, then bitter, but hekept his painful pace, avoiding the roads wherever possibli though theywould have been easier to walk than ploughed and seeded ground. This

He had no evidenc whatsoever for the feeling thatseized him as the passed by, but he sensed more than strongly that thelimo's passenger was Decker, the good doctor, still pursuit ofunderstanding.
[TRANSITION][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK][METAPHOR][PERSPECTIVE]Then, Midian.Out of nowhere, Midian. One moment the night ahead was featurelessdarkness, the next there was cluster of buildings on the horizon, theirpainted walls glimmering grey blue in the starlight. Boone stoodseveral minutes and studied the scene. There was light burning in any
[SURPRISE][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][METAPHOR]window, or on any porch. By no\ it was surely well after midnight, andthe men at women of the town, with work to rise to the followi morning,would be in bed. But not one single light| That struck him as strange.Small Midian might beforgotten by map-makers and signpost writers alike but did it not layclaim to one insomniac?; or a child who needed the comfort of a lamp
[PROBLEM][DANGER][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][CONFLICT][PERSPECTIVE][CONTEXT]burning through the night hours? More probably they were in wait forhim _ Decker and the law concealed in the shadows until he was foolishenough to step into the trap. The simplest solution would be to turntail and leave them to their vigil, but he had little enough energyleft. If he retreated now how long would he have to wait beforeattempting a return, every hour making recognition and a rest morelikely?
[SURPRISE][DANGER][PROBLEM][METAPHOR]He decided to skirt the edge of the town and get some sense of the lieof the land. If he could find no evidence of a police presence thenhe'd enter, and take the consequences. He hadn't come all this way toturn back.Midian revealed nothing of itself as he moved around its south easternflank, except perhaps its emptiness. Not only could he see no sign of
[SURPRISE]police vehicles in the streets, or secreted between the houses, hecould see no automobile of any kind: no truck, no farm vehicle. Hebegan to wonder if the-town was one of those religious communities he'dread of, whose dogmas denied them electricity or the combustionengine.But as he climbed toward the spine of a small hill on the summit ofwhich Midian stood, a second and plainer explanation occurred. Therewas nobody in Midian. The thought stopped him in his tracks. He
stared across at the houses, searching for some evidence of decay, buthe could see none. The roofs were intact, as far as he could make out,there were no buildings that appeared on the verge of collapse. Yet,with the night so quiet he could hear the whoosh of falling starsoverhead, he could hear nothing from the town. If somebody in Midianhad moaned in their sleep the night would have brought the sound hisway, but there was only silence.
[SURPRISE][FLASHBACK][EMOTION][GHOST]Midian was a ghost town.Never in his life had he felt such desolation, stood like a dogreturned home to find its mast gone, not knowing what his life nowmeant or we ever mean again.It took him several minutes to uproot himself continue his circuit ofthe town. Twenty yards on I where he'd stood, however, the height ofthe hill him sight of a scene more mysterious even than vacantMidian.
On the far side of the town lay a cemetery, vantage point gave him anuninterrupted view despite the high walls that bounded the place. Presvably it had been built to serve the entire region, for was massivelylarger than a town Midian's size cod ever have required. Many of themausoleums were j impressive scale, that much was clear even Idistance, the layout of avenues, trees and tombs le ing the cemeterythe appearance of a small city.Boone began down the slope of the hill towards his route still takinghim well clear of the town its After the adrenalin rush of finding andapproach ii Midian he felt his reserves of strength failing fast; painand exhaustion that expectation had numbed no returned with avengeance. It could not be long, knew, before his muscles gave out
[CONFLICT][DANGER][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][PROBLEM]completely and collapsed. Perhaps behind the cemetery's walls he'd Iable to find a niche to conceal himself from his pi suers and rest hisbones.There were two means of access. A small gate in the side wall, andlarge double gates that faced towards the town. He chose the former.
[PROBLEM][SURPRISE]It was latched but nc locked. He gently pushed it open, and steppedinsidsj The impression he'd had from the hill, of the cemeter as city,was here confirmed, the mausoleums risi house-high around him. Theirscale, and, now that could study them close up, their elaboration,puzzle him. What great families had occupied the town or it surrounds,moneyed enough to bury their dead in :splendour? The small communities of the prairie clung to the land as
their sustenance, but it seldom made them rich; and on the fewoccasions when it did, with oil or gold, never in such numbers. Yethere were magnificent tombs, avenue upon avenue of them, built in allmanner of styles from the classical to the baroque, and marked thoughhe was not certain his fatigued senses were telling him the truth withmotifs from warring theologies.It was beyond him. He needed sleep. The tombs had been standing a
[FLASHBACK][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][METAPHOR]century or more; the puzzle would still be there at dawn.He found himself a bed out of sight between two graves and laid hishead down. The spring growth of grass smelt sweet. He'd slept on farworse pillows, and would again.
[SURPRISE][TRANSITION][ALIEN]3>*?Z?<A Different Ape r the sound of an animal woke him, its growls Ifinding their way into floating dreams and call-Ling him down to earth. He opened his eyes, and sat up. He couldn't
[SURPRISE][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][PROBLEM]see the dog, but he heard it still. Was it behind him?; the proximityof the tombs threw echoes back and forth. Very slowly, he turned tolook over his shoulder. The darkness was deep, but did not quite
[DANGER][PROBLEM][MONSTER]conceal a large beast, its species impossible to read. There was nomisinterpreting the threat from its throat however. It didn't like hisscrutiny, to judge by the tenor of its growls.[DIALOGUE]"Hey, boy ..."he said softly, 'it's OK."Ligaments creaking, he started to stand up, knowing that if he stayedon the ground the animal had easy access to his throat. His limbs had
[SURPRISE]stiffened lying on the cold ground; he moved like a geriatric. Perhapsit was this that kept the animal from attacking, for it simply watchedhim, the crescents of the whites of its eyes the only detail he couldmake out widening as its gaze followed him into a standing position.Once on his feet he turned to face the creature, which began to movetowards him. There was something in its advance that made him think itwas wounded. He could hear it dragging one of its limbs behind it; its
[DANGER][CONFLICT][MURDER]head low, its stride ragged.He had words of comfort on his lips when an arm hooked about his neck,taking breath and words away.[DIALOGUE]"Move and I gut you."With the threat a second arm slid around his body,the fingers digging into his belly with such force had no doubt theman would make the threat gc with his bare hand.Boone took a shallow breath.

Any sense ofdirection he might have| had was forfeited in the desperation of themoment, desperation fuelled by a roar of fury from the hungryj beast,and the sound almost instant, it seemed of pursuit.The necropolis was a maze.

[DANGER][CONFLICT][SURPRISE]Peloquin was five or six yards behind him, his body still human, nakedand vulnerable, but the head entirely bestial, the mouth wide andringed with teeth like thorns. He too stopped running, perhapsexpecting Boone to draw a weapon. When none was forthcoming, he raisedhis arms towards his victim. Behind him, Jackie stumbled into view,and Boone had his first glimpse of the man. Or was it men? There were
[PROBLEM]two faces on his lumpen head, the features of both utterly distorted;eyes dislodged so they looked everywhere but ahead, mouths collidedinto a single gash, noses slits without bones. It was the face of afreak show foetus.Jackie tried one last appeal, but Peloquin's outstretched arms werealready transforming from fingertip to elbow, their delicacy giving wayto formidable power.Before the muscle was fixed he came at Boone, leaping to bring hisvictim down. Boone fell before him. It was too late now to regret his
[SURPRISE][TRANSITION]passivity. He felt the claws tear at his jacket to bare the good fleshof his chest. Peloquin raised his head and grinned, an expression thismouth was not made for; then he bit. The teeth were not long, butmany. They hurt less than Boone had expected until Peloquin pulled
[TRANSITION][MONSTER]back, tearing away a mouthful of muscle, taking skin and nipple withit.The pain shocked Boone from resignation; he began to thrash beneathPeloquin's weight. But the beast spat the morsel from its maw and cameback for better, exhaling the smell of blood in its prey's face. Therewas reason for the exhalation; on its next breath it would suck Boone'sheart and lungs from his chest. He cried out for help, and it came.
[ACTION][CONFLICT][DANGER][EMOTION][SURPRISE][CHARACTER][TRANSITION][WEAPON][PERSPECTIVE][MONSTER]Before the fatal breath could be drawn Jackie seized hold of Peloquinand dragged him from his sustenance.

His eyes pierced the gloom readily, discovering thepitiful debris the sometime tenants had left behind, all dusted by thedry earth years of prairie had borne in through broken window and theill-fitting door.

Boone had changed her life out of all
[PERSPECTIVE][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][CHARACTERIZATION][DEATH][RELIEF][EMOTION][CONTEXT][FLASHBACK][CONFLICT][RESOLUTION][CHARACTER][MURDER]recognition. His death would do the same.She thanked the doctor for the kindness of telling her himself, ratherthan leaving the duty to the police. Then she put the phone down, andwaited to believe it.
There were those amongst her peers who said she'd never have beencourted by a man like Boone if he'd been sane, meaning not that hisillness made him choose blindly but that a face like his, whichinspired such fawning in those susceptible to faces, would have been inthe company of like beauty had the mindbehind it not been unbalanced. These remarks bit deep,j because inher heart of hearts she thought them true Boone had little by way ofpossessions, but his face was his glory, demanding a devotion to itsstudy that embarrassed and discomfited him. It gave him no pleasure tobe stared at. Indeed Lori had more than once feared he'd scar himselfin the hope of spoiling whatever drew attention to him, an urgerehearsed it his total lack of interest in his appearance. She'd known
[CONFLICT][PROBLEM][DANGER][CONTEXT][CHARACTERIZATION][HORROR]him go days without showering, weeks without! shaving, half a yearwithout a hair cut. It did little to| dissuade the devotees. Hehaunted them because he in his turn was haunted, simple as that.
[DANGER][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][PERSPECTIVE]She didn't waste time trying to persuade her friends | of the fact.Indeed she kept conversation about him to 3 the minimum, particularlywhen talk turned to sex. She'd slept with Boone three times only, eachoccasion a disaster. She knew what the gossips would make of that.
[PROBLEM]But his tender, eager way with her suggested his overtures were morethan dutiful. He simply couldn't carry them through, which fact madehim rage, and fall into such depression she'd come to hold herselfback, cooling their exchanges so as not to invite further failure.She dreamt of him often though; scenarios that were unequivocallysexual. No symbolism here. Just she and Boone in bare rooms, fucking.

There'd be no more dark days, when hisconversation was a circle of defeat, no moments of sudden sunshinebecause she'd chanced upon some phrase that gave him hope. She'd not
[PROBLEM][SURPRISE][MURDER]been unprepared for an abrupt end. But nothing like this.Not Boone unmasked as a killer and shot down in a town she'd neverheard of. This was the wrong ending. But bad as it was, there was
[SURPRISE][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][TRANSITION][CLIMAX][SUSPENSE]worse to follow.After the telephone call there'd been the inevitable cross questioningby the police: had she ever suspected him of criminal activities? hadhe ever been violent in his dealings with her? She told them a dozentimes he'd never touched her except in love, and then only withcoaxing. They seemed to find an unspoken confirmation in her account
[EMOTION][TRANSITION][EXPOSITION][CONFLICT][PERSPECTIVE][SURPRISE]of his tentativeness, exchanging knowing looks as she made a blushingaccount of their lovemaking. When they'd finished with their questionsthey asked her if she would identify the body. She agreed to the duty.Though she'd been warned it would be unpleasant, she wanted agoodbye.
[SURPRISE][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][PROBLEM]It was then that the times, which had got strange of late, got strangerstill.Boone's body had disappeared.At first nobody would tell her why the identification process was beingdelayed; she was fobbed off with excuses that didn't quite ring true.Finally, however, they had no option but to tell her the truth. The
[PROBLEM][DANGER][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][EMOTION][MURDER]corpse, which had been left in the police mortuary overnight, hadsimply vanished. Nobody knew how it had been stolen- the mortuary hadbeen locked up, and there was no sign of forced entry or indeed why. Asearch was under way but to judge by the harassed faces that deliveredthis news there didn't seem to be much hope held out of finding thebody snatchers.

[FLASHBACK][PROBLEM][CONTEXT]its reminders of her timewith Boone. She wasn't quite driving blind, but as near as damn it;no map she'd been able to lay hands on marked any town called Midian.She'd heard mention of other towns, however, in exchanges between thepolice. Shere Neck was one, she remembered and that was marked on themaps. She made that her target.
[CONFLICT][PROBLEM]She knew little or nothing about the landscape she was crossing. Herfamily had come from Toronto the civilized east as her mother hadcalled it to the day she died, resenting her husband for the move thathad taken them into the hinterland. The prejudice had rubbed off. Thesight of wheat fields stretching as far as the eye could see had neverdone much for Lori's imagination and nothing she saw as she drovechanged her mind. The grain was being left to grow, its planters and
[SURPRISE][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][PROBLEM]reapers about other business. The sheer monotony of it wearied hermore than she'd anticipated. She broke her journey at McLennan, anhour's drive short of Peace River, and slept a full night undisturbedon a motel bed, to be up good and early the next morning, and offagain. She'd make Shere Neck by noon, she estimated.
[SURPRISE]Things didn't quite work out that way, however. Somewhere east ofPeace River she lost her bearings, and had to drive forty miles in whatshe suspected was the wrong direction till she found a gas station, andsomeone to help her on her way.There were twin boys playing with plastic armies in the dirt of thestation office step. Their father, whose blond hair they shared,ground a cigarette out amongst the battalions and crossed to the car.

Again, he turned on the children.[DIALOGUE]"Will you shut up?"[DIALOGUE]"It wasn't me," one of the pair protested.[DIALOGUE]"I don't give a fuck who it was!"came the reply.He moved towards them, arm raised. They were out from his shadow in

She was in luck. Driving away at speed she glanced in her

No use to fret about it. The world wasfull of brutal fathers and tyrannical mothers; and come to that, crueland uncaring children. It was the way of things. She couldn't police
[EMOTION]the species.Relief at her escape kept any other response at bay for ten minutes,but then it ran out, and a trembling overtook her, so violent she hadto stop at the first sign of civilization and find somewhere to calmherself down. There was a small diner amongst the dozen or so stores,where she ordered coffee and a sugar fix of pie, then retired to therest room to splash some cold water on her flushed cheeks. Solitude,albeit snatched, was the only cue her tears needed. Staring at her
[EMOTION][CONFLICT]blotchy, agitated features in the cracked mirror she began to sob soinsistently, nothing not even the entrance of another customer couldshame her into stopping.The newcomer didn't do as Lori would have done in such circumstances,and withdraw. Instead, catching Lori's eye in the mirror, she said:[DIALOGUE]"What is it?Men or money?"Lori wiped the tears away with her fingers.I'm sorry?

Sheryl smiled.[DIALOGUE]"As badly as I need coffee?"Sheryl Margaret Clark was her name, and she could have coaxed gossipfrom angels. By their second hour of conversation and their fifthcoffee, Lori had told her the whole sorry story, from her first meetingwith Boone to the moment she and Sheryl had exchanged looks in themirror. Sheryl herself had a story to tell more comedy than tragedyabout her lover's passion for cars and hers for his brother, which hadended in hard words and parting. She was on the road to clear herhead.

[SURPRISE][EMOTION][CONFLICT][PROBLEM]She would miss him forever. Yet there were no tears. Perhaps she'dsobbed them out back in the diner \ washroom. What she felt instead,fuelling her loss, was the mystery of how a man she'd known and lovedor loved and thought she'd known- could have died here for crimes she'dnever have suspected him of. Perhaps it was the anger she felt towards
[PROBLEM]him that prevented tears, knowing that despite his professions of lovehe'd hidden so much from her, and was now beyond the reach of herdemands for explanation. Could he not at least have left a sign? Shefound herself staring at the blood stains wondering if eyes more acutethan hers might have found some meaning in them. If prophecies couldbe read from the dregs in a coffee cup surely the last mark Boone hadmade on the world carried some significance. But she was no

The signswere just of many unsolved mysteries, chief amongst them the feelingshe voiced aloud as she stared at the stairs:[DIALOGUE]"I still love you Boone."Now there was a puzzle, that despite her anger and her bewildermentshe'd have traded the life that was left in her just to have him walkout through that door now and embrace her.But there was no reply to her declaration, however oblique.

[EMOTION][PERSPECTIVE][METAPHOR]Like you said, we won't be coming back here again."True, Lori thought. They could drive away down a straight road andnever look back. Maybe the deceased citizens of Midian envied themthat, behind their fortress walls.
[EMOTION][FLASHBACK][METAPHOR][CHARACTERIZATION][CONTEXT][PERSPECTIVE][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][CHARACTER][EXPOSITION][TRANSITION]It wasn't difficult to choose their accommodation in Shere Neck; therewere only two places available, and one was already full to brimmingwith buyers and sellers for a farm machinery sale that had just takenplace, some of the spillage occupying the rooms at the otherestablishment: the Sweetgrass Inn. Had it not been for SheryFs waywith a smile they might have been turned away from there too; but aftersome debate a twin-bedded room was found that they could share. It wasplain, but comfortable.[DIALOGUE]"You know what my mother used to tell me?"unpacked her toiletries in the bathroom.said Sheryl, as she[DIALOGUE]"What?""She used to say: there's a man out there for you, Sheryl; he's walkingaround with your name on. Mind you this is from a woman who's been
[CONFLICT][EMOTION][PERSPECTIVE][PROBLEM]looking for her particular man for thirty years and never found him.But she was always stuck on this romantic notion. You know, the man ofyour dreams is just around the next corner. And she stuck me on ittoo, damn her."
[DIALOGUE]"Still?"[DIALOGUE]"Oh yeah. I'm still looking. You'd think I'd know better, after whatI've been through. You want to shower first?"[DIALOGUE]"No.You go ahead."A party had started up in the next room, the walls too thin to mufflemuch of the noise. While Sheryltook her shower Lori lay on the bed and turned the events of the dayover in her head. The exercise didn't last long. The next thing sheknew she was being stirred from sleep by Sheryl, who'd showered and wasready for a night on the town.
[DIALOGUE]"You coming?"she wanted to know.[DIALOGUE]"I'm too tired," Lori said.[DIALOGUE]"You go have a good time."[DIALOGUE]"If there's a good time to be had said Sheryl ruefully."You'll find it Lori said.[DIALOGUE]"Give 'em something to talk about."Sheryl promised she would, and left Lori to rest, but the edge had beentaken off her fatigue. She could do no more than doze, and even thatwas interrupted at intervals by loud bursts of drunken hilarity fromthe adjacent room.She got up to go in search of a soda machine and ice, returning withher calorie-free nightcap to a less than peaceful bed. She'd take aleisurely bathe, she decided, until drink or fatigue quieted theneighbours. Immersed to her neck in hot water she felt her muscles un
[RELIEF][TRANSITION][PROBLEM]knotting themselves, and by the time she emerged she felt a good dealmellower. The bathroom had no extractor, so both the mirrors hadsteamed up. She was grateful for their discretion. The catalogue ofher frailties was quite long enough without another round ofself-scrutiny to swell it. Her neck was too thick, her face too thin,
[PROBLEM][DANGER][CONFLICT][EXPOSITION][METAPHOR][CHARACTERIZATION][HORROR]her eyes too large, her nose too small. In essence she was one excessupon another, and any attempt on her part to undo the damage merelyexacerbated it. Her hair, which she grew long to cover the sins of herneck, was so luxuriant and so dark her face looked sickly in its frame.Her mouth, which was her mother's mouth to the last flute, wasnaturally, even indecently, red, but taming its colour with a palelipstick merely made her eyes look vaster and more vulnerable thanever.
[PROBLEM][CONFLICT]It wasn't that the sum of her features was unattractive. She'd hadmore than her share of men at her feet. No, the trouble was she didn'tlook the way she felt. It was a sweet face, and she wasn't sweet;didn't want to be sweet, or thought of as sweet. Perhaps the powerful
[EMOTION][TRANSITION][FLASHBACK][MURDER]feelings that had touched her in the last few hours seeing the blood,seeing the tombs would make their mark in time. She hoped so. Thememory of them moved in her still, and she was richer for them, howeverpainful they'd been.Still naked, she wandered back into the bedroom. As she'd hoped the
[TRANSITION][SURPRISE]celebrants next door had quietened down. The music was no longer rock'n' roll, but something smoochy. She sat on the edge of the bed andran her palms back and forth over her breasts, enjoying theirsmoothness. Her breath had taken on the slow rhythm of the musicthrough the wall; music for dancing groin to groin, mouth to mouth. She
lay back on the bed, her right hand sliding down her body. She couldsmell several months' accrual of cigarette smoke in the coverlet shelay on. It made the room seem almost a public place, with its nightlycomings and goings. The thought of her nakedness in such a room, andthe smell of her skin's cleanliness on this stale bed, was acutelyarousing.
[RELIEF][TRANSITION][SURPRISE]She eased her first and middle fingers into her cunt, raising her hipsa little to meet the exploration. This was a joy she offered herselfall too seldom, her Catholic upbringing had put guilt between herinstinct and her fingertips. But tonight she was a different woman.She found the gasping places quickly, putting her feet on the edge ofthe bed and spreading her legs wide to give both hands a chance toplay.
[METAPHOR][FLASHBACK][CONFLICT][CHARACTERIZATION][PERSPECTIVE][DANGER][EMOTION][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][EXPOSITION][TRANSITION][GHOST]It wasn't Boone she pictured as the first waves of gooseflesh came.Dead men were bad lovers. Better she forgot him. His face had beenpretty, but she'd never kiss it again. His cock had been pretty too,
[PERSPECTIVE][FLASHBACK][ACTION][CHARACTERIZATION][METAPHOR][EXPOSITION][TRANSITION][RELIEF][PLOT]but she'd never stroke it, or have it in her again. All she had washerself, and pleasure for pleasure's sake. That was what she picturednow: the very act she was performing. A clean body naked on a stalebed. A woman in a strange room enjoying her own strange self.
[TRANSITION]The rhythm of the music no longer moved her. She had her own rhythm,rising and falling, rising and falling, each time climbing higher.There was no peak. Just height after height, till she was running withsweat and gorged on sensation. She lay still for several minutes.
Then, knowing sleep was quickly overtaking her and that she couldscarcely pass the night in her present position, she threw off all thecovers but a single sheet, put her head on the pillow, and fell intothe space behind her closed eyes.The sweat on her body cooled beneath the thin sheet. In sleep, she wasat Midian's necropolis, the wind coming to meet her down its avenuesfrom all directions at once north, south, east and west chilling her asit whipped her hair above her head, and ran up inside her blouse. Thewind was not invisible. It had a texture, as though it carried a
[DEATH][CONFLICT]weight of dust, the motes steadily gumming up her eyes and sealing hernose, finding its way into her underwear and up into her body by thoseroutes too.It was only as the dust blinded her completely that she realized whatit was- the remains of the dead, the ancient dead, blown on contrarywinds from pyramids and mausoleums, from vaults and dolmen, charnelhouses and cremator ia Coffin-dust, and human ash, and bone pounded tobits, all blown to Midian, and catching her at the crossroads.She felt the dead inside her. Behind her lids; in her throat; carriedup towards her womb. And despite the
[EMOTION][CONFLICT][PERSPECTIVE][FLASHBACK]chill, and the fury of the four storms, she had no fear of them, nordesire to expel them. They sought her warmth and her womanliness. Shewould not reject them.[DIALOGUE]"Where's Boone?" she asked in her dream, assuming the dead would know.He was one of their number after all.
[CONFLICT][DEATH][PROBLEM][DANGER]She knew he was not far from her, but the wind was getting stronger,buffeting her from all directions, howling around her head.[DIALOGUE]"Boone?"she said again.The wind heard her.[DIALOGUE]"I want Boone.Bring him to me."Its howling grew louder.But somebody else was nearby, distracting her from hearing its reply.[DIALOGUE]"He's dead, Lori," the voice said.She tried to ignore the idiot voice, and concentrate on interpretingthe wind. But she'd lost her place in the conversation, and had to
[CONFLICT][FLASHBACK][PROBLEM]begin again.[DIALOGUE]"It's Boone I want," she said.[DIALOGUE]"Bring me '"Afo![DIALOGUE]"Again, that damn voice.She tried a third time, but the violence of the wind had become anotherviolence; she was being shaken."Lori!
Wake up![DIALOGUE]"She clung to sleep, to the dream of wind. It might yet tell her whatshe needed to know if she could resist the assault of consciousness amoment longer."Boone!" she called again, but the winds were receding from her, andtaking the dead with them. She felt the itch of their exit from herveins and senses. What knowledge they had to impart was going withthem. She was powerless to hold them.

All thefretfulness she'd felt during her -irst visit here had disappeared.Though this was still the town where Boone had died, she could not hateit for that. Rather the reverse: she and it were allies, both markedby the man's passing.
[EXPOSITION]It was not the town itself she'd come to visit however, it was thegraveyard, and it did not disappoint her. The sun gleamed on themausoleums, the sharp shadows flattering their elaboration. Even thegrass that sprouted between the tombs was a more brilliant green today.There was no wind, from any quarter; no breath of the dream-storms,bringing the dead. Within the high walls there was an extraordinary
[PROBLEM]stillness, as if the outside world no longer existed. Here was a placesacred to the dead, who were not the living ceased, but almost anotherspecies, requiring rites and prayers that belonged uniquely to them.She was surrounded on every side by such signs: epitaphs in English,French, Polish and Russian; images of veiled women and shattered urns,saints whose martyrdom she could only guess at, stone dogs sleepingupon their masters' tombs all the symbolism that accompanied this otherpeople. And the more she explored, the more she found herself askingthe question she'd posed the day before: why was the cemetery so big?
And why, as became apparent the more tombs she studied, were there somany nationalities laid here? She thought of her dream; of the windthat had come from all quarters of the earth. It was as if there'dbeen something prophetic in it. The thought didn't worry her. If that
[SURPRISE]was the way the world worked by omens and prophecies then it was atleast a system, and she had lived too long without one. Love hadfailed her, perhaps this would not.It took her an hour, wandering down the hushed avenues to reach theback wall of the cemetery against which she found a row of animals'graves cats interred beside birds, dogs beside cats; at peace with eachother as common clay. It was an odd sight. Though she knew of other
animal cemeteries she'd never heard of pets being laid in the sameconsecrated ground as their owners. But then should she be surprisedat anything here? The place was a law unto itself, built far from anywho would care or condemn.Turning from the back wall, she could see no sign of the front gate,nor could she remember which of the avenues led back there. It didn't
matter. She felt secure in the emptiness of the place, and there was agood deal she wanted to see: sepulchres whose architecture, toweringover its fellows, invited admiration. Choosing a route that would takein half a dozen of the most promising, she began an idling returnjourney. The sun was warmer by the minute now, as it climbed towardsnoon. Though her pace was slow she broke out into a sweat, and her
[DANGER]throat became steadily drier. It would be no short drive to findsomewhere to quench her thirst. But parched throat or no, she didn'thurry. She knew she'd never come here again. She intended to leave
with her memories well stocked.Along the way were several tombs which had been virtually overtaken bysaplings planted in front of them. Evergreens mostly, reminders of thelife eternal, the trees flourished in the seclusion of the walls, fedwell on rich soil. In some cases their spreading rootshad cracked the very memorials they'd been planted to offer shade andprotection. These scenes of verdancy and ruin she found particularly
[EMOTION][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][DANGER]poignant. She was lingering at one when the perfect silence wasbroken.Hidden in the foliage somebody, or something, was panting. Sheautomatically stepped back, out of the tree's shadow and into the hotsun. Shock made her heart beat furiously, its thump deafening her to
[SURPRISE]the sound that had excited it. She had to wait a few moments, andlisten hard, to be sure she'd not imagined the sound. There was noerror. Something was in hiding beneath the branches of the tree, whichwere so weighed by their burden of leaves they almost touched theground. The sound, now that she listened more carefully, was not
[PROBLEM][METAPHOR][DANGER][SURPRISE][CHARACTERIZATION][CONTEXT][PERSPECTIVE][CONFLICT][TRANSITION]human; nor was it healthy. Its roughness and raggedness suggested adying animal.She stood in the heat of the sun for a minute or more, just staringinto the mass of foliage and shadow, trying to catch some sight of thecreature. Occasionally there was a movement: a body vainly trying toright itself, a desperate pawing at the ground as the creature tried torise. Its helplessness touched her. If she failed to do what she
[DANGER][DEATH][ACTION][EMOTION][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][PERSPECTIVE][PROBLEM][FLASHBACK][CONTEXT][METAPHOR]could for it the animal would certainly perish, knowing this was thethought that moved her to action that someone had heard its agony andpassed it by.She stepped back into the shadow. For a space the panting stoppedcompletely. Perhaps the creature was fearful of her, and reading herapproach as aggression was preparing some final act of defence.
[SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE]Readying herself to retreat before claws and teeth, she parted theouter twigs and peered through the mesh of branches. Her firstimpression was not one of sight or sound but of smell: a bitter-sweetscent that was not unpleasant, its source the pale flanked creature shenow made out in the murk, gazing at her wide-eyed. It was a younganimal, she guessed, but of no species she could name.A wild cat of some kind, perhaps, but that the skin resembled deerhide rather than fur. It watched her warily, its neck barely able to
support the weight of its delicately marked head. Even as she returnedits gaze it seemed to give up on life. Its eyes closed and its headsank to the ground.The resilience of the branches defied any further approach. Rather
[CONFLICT][ACTION][DANGER][PROBLEM][WEAPON][MONSTER]than attempting to bend them aside she began to break them in order toget to the failing creature. They were living wood, and fought back.Halfway through the thicket a particularly truculent branch snappedback in her face with such stinging force it brought a shout of painfrom her. She put her hand to her cheek. The skin to the right of her
[ACTION][TRANSITION][EMOTION][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][PROBLEM]mouth was broken. Dabbing the blood away she attacked the branch withfresh vigour, at last coming within reach of the animal. It was almostbeyond responding to her touch, its eyes momentarily fluttering open asshe stroked its flank, then closing again. There was no sign that shecould see of a wound, but the body beneath her hand was feverish andfull of tremors.
[DEATH][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][DANGER][MONSTER]As she struggled to pick the animal up it began to urinate, wetting herhands and blouse, but she drew it to her nevertheless, a dead weight inher arms. Beyond the spasms that ran through its nervous system therewas no power left in its muscles. Its limbs hung limply, its head thesame. Only the smell she'd first encountered had any strength,intensifying as the creature's final moments approached.Something like a sob reached her ears.
[DEATH][TRANSITION][DANGER][FLASHBACK][CONFLICT][EMOTION][SURPRISE][MURDER]She froze.Again, the sound. Off to her left, some way, and barely suppressed.She stepped back, out of the shadow of the evergreen, bringing thedying animal with her. As the sunlight fell on the creature it
[SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][PROBLEM][FLASHBACK][CONTEXT][MONSTER]responded with a violence utterly belied by its apparent frailty, itslimbs jerking madly. She stepped back into the shade, instinct ratherthan analysis telling her the brightness was responsible. Only thendid she look again in the direction from which the sob had come.The door of one of the mausoleums further down the avenue a massivestructure of cracked marble stood ajar, and in the column of darknessbeyond she could vaguely make out a human figure. Vaguely, because it
[PROBLEM][SURPRISE][DEATH][EMOTION][CONFLICT][SUSPENSE][TRANSITION][DANGER][MONSTER]was dressed in black, and seemed to be veiled.She could make no sense of this scenario. The dying animal, tormentedby light; the sobbing woman surely a woman in the doorway, dressed formourning. What was the association?
[EMOTION][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][DIALOGUE]"Who are you?"she called out.The mourner seemed to shrink back into the shadows as she wasaddressed, then regretted the move and approached the open door again,but so very tentatively the connection between animal and woman becameclear.She's afraid of the sun too, Lori thought. They belonged together,animal and mourner, the woman sobbing for the creature Lori had in herarms.She looked at the pavement that lay between where she stood and themausoleum. Could she get to the door of the tomb without having to
[TRANSITION][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][CONFLICT][EMOTION]step back into the sun, and so hasten the creature's demise? Perhaps,with care. Planning her route before she moved, she started to crosstowards the mausoleum, using the shadows like stepping stones. Shedidn't look up at the door- her attention was wholly focused on keepingthe animal from the light but she could feel the mourner's presence,willing her on. Once the woman gave voice; not with a word but with a
[DEATH][SURPRISE]soft sound, a cradle-side sound, addressed not to Lori but to the dyinganimal.With the mausoleum door three or four yards from her, Lori dared tolook up. The woman in the door could be patient no longer. Shereached out from her refuge, her arms bared as the garment she worerode back, her flesh exposed to the sunlight. The skin was white as
[TRANSITION]ice, as paper but only for an instant. As the fingers stretched torelieve Lori of her burden theydarkened and swelled as though instantly bruised. The mourner made acry of pain, and almost fell back into the tomb as she withdrew herarms, but not before the skin broke and trails of dust yellowish, likepollen burst from her fingers and fell through the sunlight on to thepatio.Seconds later, Lori was at the door; then through it into the safety ofthe darkness beyond. The room was no more than an antechamber. Two
[EMOTION][CONFLICT][DANGER][SURPRISE]doors led out of it: one into a chapel of some sort, the other belowground. The woman in mourning was standing at this second door, whichwas open, as far from the wounding light as she could get. In herhaste, her veil had fallen. The face beneath was fine-boned, and thinalmost to the point of being wasted, which lent additional force to hereyes, which caught, even in the darkest corner of the room, some traceof light from through the open door, so that they seemed almost toglow.
[CONFLICT]Lori felt no trace of fear. It was the other woman who trembled as shenursed her sunstruck hands, her gaze moving from Lori's bewildered faceto the animal.[DIALOGUE]"I'm afraid it's dead," Lori said, not knowing what disease afflictedthis woman, but recognizing her grief from all too recent memory.[DIALOGUE]"No," the woman said with quiet conviction.[DIALOGUE]"She can't die."Her words were statement not entreaty, but the stillness in Lori's armscontradicted such certainty. If the creature wasn't yet dead it wassurely beyond recall.[DIALOGUE]"Will you bring her to me?"the woman asked.Lori hesitated. Though the weight of the body was making her arms
[EMOTION][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][DANGER]ache, and she wanted the duty done, she didn't want to cross thechamber.[DIALOGUE]"Please," the woman said, reaching out with wounded hands.Relenting, Lori left the comfort of the door and the sunlit patiobeyond. She'd taken two or three steps, however, when she heard thesound of whispering.There could only be one source: the stairs. There were people in the
[CONFLICT][EMOTION][FLASHBACK][PERSPECTIVE][HORROR]crypt. She stopped walking, childhood superstitions rising up in her.Fear of tombs; fear of stairs descending; fear of the Underworld."It's nobody the woman said, her face pained.
[CONFLICT]Babette.[DIALOGUE]""Please, bring meAs if to further reassure Lori she took a step away from the stairs,murmuring to the animal she'd called Babette. Either the words, or thewoman's proximity, or perhaps the cool darkness of the chamber, won aresponse from the creature: a tremor that ran down its spine like anelectric charge, so strong Lori almost lost hold of it. The woman'smurmurs grew louder, as if she were chiding the dying thing, heranxiety to claim it suddenly urgent. But there was an impasse. Lori
[SURPRISE][TRANSITION][ACTION][CONFLICT][FLASHBACK][EMOTION]was no more willing to approach the entrance to the crypt than thewoman to come another step towards the outer door, and in the secondsof stasis the animal found new life. One of its claws seized Lori'sbreast as it began to writhe in her embrace.The chiding became a shout "Babettel'but if the creature heard, it didn't care to listen. Its motion becamemore violent: a mingling of fit and sensuality. One moment it
[CONFLICT][DANGER][PROBLEM][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][HORROR]shuddered as though tortured; the next it moved like a snake sloughingoff its skin."Don't look, don't lookl' she heard the woman say, but Lori wasn'tabout to take her eyes off this horrendous dance. Nor could she givethe creature over to the woman's charge, while the claw gripped her sotightly any attempt to separate them would draw blood.But that Don't Look\ had purpose. Now it was Lori's turn to raise her

In the moment it lost its
coherence the matter was ready to be out of her grasp, but somehow theessence of the thing its will, perhaps; perhaps its soul drew it backfor the business of re-making. The last part of the beast to melt wasthe claw, its disintegration sending a throb of pleasure through Lori'sbody. It did not distract her from the fact that she was released.Horrified, she couldn't get what she held from her embrace fast enough,tipping it into the mourner's outstretched arms like so muchexcrement.
[EMOTION][DIALOGUE]"Jesus," she said, backing away.[DIALOGUE]"Jesus.Jesus."There was no horror on the woman's face however; only joy. Tears ofwelcome rolled down her pale cheeks, and fell into the melting pot sheheld. Lori looked away towards the sunlight. After the gloom of theinterior it was blinding. She was momentarily disoriented, and closed
[SURPRISE][CONFLICT][FLASHBACK][PROBLEM][RELIEF][EMOTION][TRANSITION][HORROR]her eyes to allow herself a reprieve from both tomb and light.It was sobbing that made her open her eyes. Not the woman this time,but a child, a girl of four or five, lying naked where the muck oftransformation had been.[DIALOGUE]"Babette," the woman said.Impossible, reason replied. This thin white child could not be the
[SURPRISE][METAPHOR][CONFLICT][EXPOSITION][CHARACTERIZATION][PROBLEM][PLOT][PERSPECTIVE][FLASHBACK][SUSPENSE][SETTING][TRANSITION][HORROR]animal she'd rescued from beneath the tree. It was sleight of hand, orsome idiot delusion she'd foisted upon herself. Impossible; allimpossible.[DIALOGUE]"She likes to play outside," the woman was saying, looking up from thechild at Lori. "And I tell her: never, never in the sun. Never play
[CONFLICT][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][CHARACTERIZATION][METAPHOR][PERSPECTIVE][FLASHBACK][SETTING][CONTEXT]in the sun. But she's a child. She doesn't understand."Impossible, reason repeated. But somewhere in her gut Lori had already
[EMOTION][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][CONTEXT][PERSPECTIVE][PROBLEM][ALIEN]given up trying to deny. Theanimal had been real. The transformation had been real. Now here wasa living child, weeping in her mother's arms. She too was real. Every
[DANGER][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][EMOTION][FLASHBACK][TRANSITION]moment she wasted saying No to what she knew, was a moment lost tocomprehension. That her world-view couldn't contain such a mysterywithout shattering was its liability, and a problem for another day.For now she simply wanted to be away; into the sunlight where she knewthese shape-shifters feared to follow. Not daring to take her eyes offthem until she was in the sun, she reached out to the wall to guide hertentative backward steps. But Babette's mother wanted to hold her a

You stole him!'Rachel paused and looked back up at Lori, her face barely visible inthe blackness of the stairs.[DIALOGUE]"We stole nothing," she said, her reply without rancour.[DIALOGUE]"So where is he?"Lori demanded.Rachel turned away, and the shadows took her completely from view.[DIALOGUE]"Tell me! Please God!" Lori yelled down after her. Suddenly she wascrying: in a turmoil of rage and fear and frustration. "Tell me,
[EMOTION][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][CONFLICT]please.[DIALOGUE]"Desperation carried her down the stairs after Rachel, her shoutsbecoming appeals."Wait... talk to me .. ."
[EMOTION][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][TRANSITION][DANGER][GHOST]She took three steps, then a fourth. On the fifth she stopped, orrather her body stopped, the muscles of her legs becoming rigid withouther instruction, refusing to carry her another step into the darknessof the crypt. Her skin was suddenly crawling with gooseflesh; herpulse thumping in her ears. No force of will could overrule the animalimperative forbidding her to descend; all she could do was stand rootedto the spot, and stare into the depths. Even her tears had suddenly
[DANGER][PERSPECTIVE][PROBLEM][TRANSITION][EMOTION][CONFLICT][HORROR]dried, and the spit gone from her mouth, so she could no more speakthan walk. Not that she wanted to call down into the darkness now, forfear the forces there answered her summons. Though she could seenothing of them her gut knew they were more terrible by far than Racheland her beast-child. Shape-shifting was almost a natural act besidethe skills these others had to hand. She felt their perversity as a
[SURPRISE][METAPHOR][PROBLEM][DANGER][DEATH]quality of the air. She breathed it in and out. It scoured her lungsand hurried her heart.If they had Boone's corpse as a plaything it was beyond reclamation.
She would have to take comfort from the hope that his spirit wassomewhere brighter.Defeated, she took a step backwards. The shadows seemed unwilling torelinquish her, however. She felt them weave themselves into herblouse and hook themselves on her eyelashes, a thousand tiny holds uponher, slowing her retreat.
[CONFLICT][SURPRISE][DANGER][DIALOGUE]"I won't tell anyone," she murmured.[DIALOGUE]"Please let me goBut the shadows held on, their power a promise of retribution if shedefied them."I promise,[DIALOGUE]" she said."What more can I do?"And suddenly, they capitulated. She hadn't realized how strong theirclaim was until it was withdrawn. She stumbled backwards, falling upthe stairs into the light of the antechamber. Turning her back on the
[DANGER][CONFLICT][SURPRISE]crypt she fled for the door, and out into the sun.It was too bright. She covered her eyes, holding herself upright bygripping the stone portico, so that she could accustom herself to itsviolence. It took several minutes, standing against the mausoleum,shaking and rigid by turn. Only when she felt able to see through
[DANGER]half-closed eyes did she attempt to walk, her route back to the maingate a farrago of cul-de-sacs and missed turnings.By the time she reached it, however, she'd more or less accustomedherself to the brutality of light and sky. Her body was still not backat her mind's disposal however. Her legs refused to carry her morethan a few paces up the hill to Midian without threatening to drop herto the ground. Her system, overdosed on adrenalin, was cavorting. But
[CONFLICT][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][DANGER][FLASHBACK][PERSPECTIVE]at least she was alive. For a short while there on the stairs it hadbeen touch and go. The shadows that had held her by lash and threadcould have taken her, she had no doubt of that. Claimed her for theUnderworld and snuffed her out. Why had they released her? Perhaps
[SURPRISE][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][PERSPECTIVE][TRANSITION][CONTEXT]because she'd saved the child;perhaps because she'd sworn silence and they'd trusted | her. Neither,however, seemed the motives of monsters and she had to believe thatwhat lived beneath! Midian's cemetery deserved that name. Who other!

They might callthemselves the Nightbreed, but neither words nor gestures of good faithcould disguise their true nature.She had escaped demons things of rot and wickedness and she would haveoffered up a prayer of thanks for her deliverance if the sky had notbeen so wide and bright, and so plainly devoid of deities to hear.

How could it not beobvious, in her face, in her voice? Such fears proved groundless.
Either she was better at concealment than she'd thought, or Sheryl wasmore insensitive. Either way, Sheryl asked only the most perfunctoryquestions about Lori's return visit to Midian, before moving on to talkof Curtis.[DIALOGUE]"I want you to meet him," she said, 'just to be sure I'm notdreaming.[DIALOGUE]""I'm going to go home, Sheryl,[DIALOGUE]" Lori said."Not tonight, surely.
[CONFLICT][EMOTION]It's too late.[DIALOGUE]"She was right; the day was too advanced for Lori to contemplate ahomeward trip. Nor could she fabricate a reason for denying Sheryl'srequest without offending."You won't feel like a lemon, I promise,[DIALOGUE]" Sheryl said. "He said hewanted to meet you. I've told him all about you. Well ... not all.
[EMOTION]But enough, you know, about how we met.[DIALOGUE]" She made a forlorn face. "Sayyou'll come,[DIALOGUE]" she said."I'll come.[DIALOGUE]""Fabulous!I'll call him right now."While Sheryl went about making her call Lori took ashower. There was news of the night's arrangements within twominutes.

"He'll even find a friend for you_ /[DIALOGUE]"No, Sheryl '"I think he was just kidding,[DIALOGUE]" came the reply. Sheryl appeared at thebathroom door. "He's got a funny sense of humour,[DIALOGUE]" she said. "You
[RELIEF][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][METAPHOR][FLASHBACK]know, when you're not sure if someone's making a joke or not? He'slike that."Great, Lori thought, a failed comedian. But there was somethingundeniably comforting about coming back to Sheryl and this girlishpassion. Her endless talk of Curtis- none of which gave Lori more than
[RELIEF][CHARACTER][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][SURPRISE][CHARACTERIZATION]a street artist's portrait of the man: all surface and no insight wasthe perfect distraction from thoughts of Midian and its revelations.The early evening was so filled with good humour, and the rituals ofpreparing for a night on the town, that on occasion Lori found herselfwondering if all that had happened in the necropolis had not been ahallucination. But she had evidence that confirmed the memory: the cutbeside her mouth from that wayward branch. It was little enough sign,but the sharp hurt of it kept her from doubting her sanity. She had
been to Midian. She had held the shape-shifter in her arms, and stoodon the crypt stairs gazing into a miasma so profound it could haverotted the faith of a saint.Though the unholy world beneath the cemetery was as far from Sheryl andher whirlwind romances as night from day, it was no less real for that.In time she would have to address that reality; find a place for it,though it defied all sense, all logic. For now, she would keep it in

[DIALOGUE]"Didn't I tell you he had this weird sense of humour?"The restaurant he'd named had been completely gutted by fire, severalweeks ago to judge by the state of the timbers.[DIALOGUE]"Are you sure you got the right address?"Lori asked.Sheryl laughed.
[METAPHOR][DIALOGUE]"I tell you it's one of his jokes she said."So we've laughed,[DIALOGUE]" said Lori."When do we get to eat?[DIALOGUE]""He's probably watching us Sheryl said, her good humour slightlyforced.Lori looked around for some sign of the voyeur. Though there wasnothing to fear on the streets of a town like this, even on a Saturdaynight, the neighbourhood was far from welcoming. Every other shop

It was no place theywanted to linger.[DIALOGUE]"I don't see him she said."Neither do I.[DIALOGUE]""So what do we do now?" Lori asked, doing her best to keep any traceof irritation from her voice.

I'm OK.[DIALOGUE]" She was already immersed in the darkness of theinterior. The smell of burned wood and fabric stung Lori's nostrils."Curtis?"she heard Sheryl call.A car went past, its engine badly tuned. The passenger, a youth,
prematurely balding, leaned out of the window.[DIALOGUE]"Need any help?"[DIALOGUE]"No thanks," Lori yelled back, not certain if the question was smalltown courtesy or a come-on. Probably the latter, she decided, as thecar picked up speed and disappeared; people were the same all over. Hermood, which had improved by leaps and bounds since she'd been back inSheryl's company, was rapidly souring. She didn't like being on thisempty street, with what little was left of the day sliding towardsextinction. The night, which had always been a place of promise,
belonged too much to the Breed, who had taken its name for themselves.And why not? All darkness was one darkness in the end. Of heart orheavens; one darkness. Even now, in Midian, they'd be dragging back
[SURPRISE][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][DANGER][EMOTION][PERSPECTIVE][FLASHBACK][PROBLEM][SUSPENSE][ACTION][METAPHOR]the doors of the mausoleums, knowing the starlight would not witherthem. She shuddered at the thought.Off down one of the streets she heard the car engine rev up, and roar,then a squeal of brakes. Were the Good Samaritans coming round for asecond look?
[CONFLICT][DIALOGUE]"Sheryl?"she called out.[DIALOGUE]"Where are you?"The joke, if joke it had been and not Sheryl's error had long sincelost what questionable humour it had. She wanted to get back into thecar and drive, back to the hotel if necessary.[DIALOGUE]"Sheryl?Are you there?"There was laughter from the interior of the building;Sheryl's gurgling laughter. Suspecting now her compliance in thisfiasco, Lori stepped through the door in search of the tricksters.The laughter came again, then broke off as Sheryl said:[DIALOGUE]"Curtis," in a tone of mock indignation that decayed into further inanelaughter. So the great lover was here. Lori half contemplated
[PERSPECTIVE][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][EMOTION][CONTEXT][CHARACTERIZATION][FLASHBACK][DANGER]returning to the street, getting back into the car and leaving them totheir damn fool games. But the thought of the evening alone in thehotel room, listening to more partying, spurred her on through anassault course of burnt furniture.Had it not been for the brightness of the floor tiles, throwing thestreet light up towards the cage of ceiling beams, she might not haverisked advancing far. But ahead she could dimly see the archwaysthrough which Sheryl's laughter had floated. She made her way towards
[TRANSITION][PROBLEM][CONTEXT]it. All sound had ceased. They were watching her every tentativestep. She felt their scrutiny.
[CONFLICT][DIALOGUE]"Come on, guys she said."Joke's over.I'm hungry."There was no reply. Behind her, on the street, she heard theSamaritans yelling. Retreat was not advisable. She advanced, stepping
[SURPRISE][METAPHOR][CONFLICT]through the archway.Her first thought was: he only told half a lie, this was a restaurant.The exploration had taken her into a kitchen, where probably the firehad started. It too was tiled in white, surfaces smoke-stained butstill bright enough to lend the whole interior, which was large, an oddluminescence. She stood in the doorway, and scanned the room. The
[FLASHBACK][PERSPECTIVE][EMOTION]largest of the cookers was placed in the centre, racks of shiningutensils still hanging above it, truncating her view. The jokers hadto be in hiding on the other side of the range, it was the only refugethe room offered.Despite her anxieties, she felt an echo here of remembered games ofhide-and-seek. The first game, because the simplest. How she'd loved
[CONFLICT][DANGER][EMOTION][PROBLEM][METAPHOR][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE][HORROR]to be terrorized by her father; chased and caught. If only he wereherein hiding now, she found herself thinking, waiting to embrace her. Butcancer had caught him long since, by the throat.[DIALOGUE]"Sheryl?"she said."I give up.
[CONFLICT][DANGER][SURPRISE][DEATH][METAPHOR][EXPOSITION][MURDER]Where are you?"Even as she spoke her advance brought her within sight of one of theplayers, and the game ended.Sheryl was not in hiding, unless death was hiding. She was crouchedagainst the cooker, the darkness around her too wet for shadow, herhead thrown back, her face slashed open.
[DANGER][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][WEAPON][METAPHOR][GHOST][DIALOGUE]"Jesus God."Behind Lori, a sound. Somebody coming to find her. Too late to hide.She'd be caught. And not by loving arms; not by her father, playing

This was the monster itself.She turned to see its face before it took her, but running at her was asewing-box doll: zipper for mouth, buttons for eyes, all sewn on whitelinen and tied around the monster's face so tightly his saliva darkeneda patch around his mouth. She was denied the face but not the teeth.
He held them above his head, gleaming knives, their blades fine asgrass-stalks, sweeping down to stab out her eyes. She threw herselfout of their reach but he was after her in an instant, the mouth behindthe zipper calling her name.[DIALOGUE]"Better get it over with, Lori."The blades were coming at her again, but she was quicker.

The news was not good. The fire door was blocked by
[CONFLICT]burnt timbers; her only exit was the arch through which she'd entered,and the Mask stood between her and it, sharpening his teeth on eachother.He started towards her again. No jibes from him now; the time for talkwas over. As he closed on her she thought of Midian. Surely she'd not
[DANGER][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][WEAPON][DEATH][PROBLEM][ACTION][MURDER]survived its terrors to be hacked to death by some lone psycho?Fuck him!As the knives slid towards her she snatched a pot from the rack abovethe range and brought it up to meet his face. It connected squarely.
[SURPRISE][TRANSITION]Her strength shocked her. The Mask reeled, dropping one of his blades.There was no sound from behind the linen, however. He merelytransferred the remaining blade from right hand to left, shook his headas if to stop it singing, and came at her again, at a rush. She barely
[TRANSITION][CONFLICT][ACTION][WEAPON][EXPOSITION][FLASHBACK]had time to raise the pan in defence. The blade slid down it and mether hand. For a moment there was no pain, nor even blood. Then bothcame in profusion, the pan falling from her hand at her feet. Now he
[CONFLICT]made a sound, a cooing sound, the tilt of his head suggesting that itwas the blood he was staring at, as it ran from the wound he'dfathered.She looked towards the door, calculating the time it would take to getthere against his speed of pursuit. But before she could act the Maskbegan his last advance. The knife was not raised. Nor was his voice,
[SURPRISE][CONFLICT][DANGER][WEAPON][GORE]when he spoke.[DIALOGUE]"Lori," he said.[DIALOGUE]"We must talk, you and me."[DIALOGUE]"Keep the fuck away."To her amazement he obeyed the instruction. She seized what littletime this offered to claim his other blade from the floor. She wasless competent with her unwounded hand, but he was a large target. Shecould do him damage; preferably through the heart.

He took a step back, his hands going upto his face to protect himself, and she took the chance while she hadit, bolting for the archway. She got through it and into therestaurant itself before she heard his pursuit. By that time she had
[TRANSITION][CONFLICT][ACTION][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][EXPOSITION][WITCH]sufficient lead to reach the outer door and fling herself through it,onto the street. Once on the sidewalk she immediately turned and facedthe door through which he would come. But he had no intention offollowing her into the light.[DIALOGUE]"Clever bitch," he said, from the darkness. "I'll get you. When I've
[MURDER]got Boone I'll come back for you; you just count the breaths tillthen."Eyes still fixed on the door she backed off down the sidewalk towardsthe car. Only now did she realize that she still carried the murderweapon, her grip so strong she felt almost glued to it. She had nochoice but to take it with her, and give it, and her evidence, to thepolice. Back to the car, she opened the door and got in, only looking
[ACTION][WEAPON][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][HAUNTED HOUSE]away from the burnt out building when the locks were on. Then shethrew the knife onto the floor in front of the passenger seat, startedthe engine, and drove.The choice before her came down to this: the police, or Midian. Anight of interrogation or a return to the necropolis. If she chose the
[PROBLEM][DANGER][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK][TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][METAPHOR][MURDER]former she would not be able to warn Boone of Decker's pursuit. Butthen suppose Decker had been lying, and Boone had not survived thebullets? She'd not only be fleeing from the scene of a murder butputting herself within reach of the Nightbreed, and uselessly.Yesterday she would have chosen to go to the law. She would have
trusted that its procedures would make all these mysteries come clear,that they would believe her story, and bring Decker to justice. Butyesterday she'd thought beasts were beasts, and children, children,she'd thought that only the dead lived in the earth, and that they werepeaceful there. She'd thought doctors healed, and that when themadman's mask was raised she would say: [DIALOGUE]"But of course, that's amadman's face."All wrong; all so wrong.

They began like snowblown towards the windscreen, flakes of brightness that defied theglass and flew past her, whining as they went. As her dreamy state
[PERSPECTIVE]worsened, she seemed to see faces flying at her, and commas of lifelike foetuses, which whispered as they tumbled past. The spectacle didnot distress her; quite the reverse. It seemed to confirm a scenarioher hallucinating mind had created: that she, like Boone, was living acharmed life. Nothing could harm her, not tonight. Though her cut

That was why the visions came, racinginto the headlamps, and skipping over the car to burst above her inshowers of white lights. They were welcoming her.
[SURPRISE][METAPHOR][FLASHBACK][TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE]To Midian.Once she looked in the mirror and thought she glimpsed a car behindher, its lights turned off. But when she looked again it had gone.Perhaps it had never been there. Ahead lay the town, its houses
[DANGER][CONFLICT]blinded by her headlights. She drove down the main street, all the wayto the graveyard gates.The mingled intoxications of blood loss and exhaustion had dulled allfear of this place. If she could survive the malice of the living shecould surely survive the dead, or their companions. And Boone was
[EMOTION][DANGER][TRANSITION][ACTION]here; that hope had hardened into certainty as she drove. Boone washere, and finally she'd be able to take him into her arms.She stumbled out of the car, and almost fell flat on her face.[DIALOGUE]"Get up ..."she told herself.The lights were still coming at her, though she was no longer moving,but now all trace of detail in them had vanished. There was only thebrightness, its ferocity threatening to wash the whole world away.

[DANGER][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][EMOTION][MURDER]Beyond help, in the giving or the taking.She was alone, and the man with the gun was closing on her.Decker took the mask from his pocket; the button mask he felt so safebehind. Oh, the number of times, in those tiresome days with Boone,teaching him the dates and the places of the murders he was inheriting,when Decker's pride had almost brimmed over and he'd itched to claimthe crimes back. But he needed the scapegoat more than the quick
[METAPHOR][TRANSITION][DANGER][CONFLICT][FLASHBACK][PROBLEM][WEAPON][PERSPECTIVE][SURPRISE][EMOTION][CHARACTERIZATION][RELIEF][CONTEXT][CHARACTER][MURDER]thrill of confession, to keep suspicion at bay. Boone's admitting tothe crimes wouldn't have been an end to it all of course. In time theMask would start speaking to its owner again, demanding to be bloodied,and the killings would have to begin afresh. But not until Decker hadfound himself another name, and another city to set up his store in.
[EMOTION][PLOT]Boone had spoiled those well-laid plans, but he'd getno chance to tell what he knew.Of' Button Face would see to that.Decker pulled the mask on. It smelt of his excitement. As soon as he

It sniffed the air for him, even throughthe thickness of his trousers and underwear. It smelt the victim thatran ahead of him. The Mask didn't care that his prey was female; he
[CONFLICT][MURDER]got the murder-hard for anyone. In his time he'd had a heat for oldmen, pissing their pants as they went down in front of him; for girls,sometimes, sometimes women; even children. Of' Button Face looked withthe same cross-threaded eyes on the whole of humanity.This one, this woman in the dark up ahead, meant no more to the Maskthan any of the others. Once they started to panic and bleed, they
[MURDER]were all the same. He followed her with steady step; that was one ofButton Head's trade marks, the executioner's tread. And she fledbefore him, her pleas deteriorating into snot and gasps. Though shehadn't got breath to call for her hero, no doubt she prayed he'd stillcome for her. Poor bitch. Didn't she know they never showed? He'd
[WEAPON][ACTION][CONFLICT][DANGER]heard them all called upon in his time, begged for, bargained with, theHoly Fathers and Mothers, the champions, the inter ceders none of themever showed.But her agony would be over soon. A shot through the back of the headto bring her down, and then he'd take the big knife, the heavy knife,to her face, the way he did with all of them. Criss cross, crisscross,like the threads in his eye, till there was nothing left to look at butmeat.

[CONFLICT][DIALOGUE]"It's quicker that way."She tried to get up one final time, but her legs had given outcompletely, and the wash of whiteness was practically all consuming.Giddily, she turned her head in the direction of Decker's voice, and ina trough between the white waves, she saw that he'd put his mask backon. Its face was a death's head.He raised the gun In the ground beneath her, she felt tremors. Was it
[SURPRISE][WEAPON][DANGER][FLASHBACK]the sound of a shot, perhaps? She couldn't see the gun any longer, oreven Decker. One final wave had washed him from sight. But her bodyfelt the earth rock, and through the whine in her head she heardsomebody calling the name of the man she'd hoped to find here.
[SURPRISE][CONFLICT][PROBLEM]Boone!She didn't hear an answer- perhaps there wasn't one but the call cameagain, as if summoning him back into the earth.Before she could muster the last of her power to counter the call hergood arm gave out beneath her and she was face down on the ground.Button Head walked towards his quarry, disappointed that the womanwould not be conscious to hear his final benediction. He liked to
offer a few words of insight at the penultimate moment; words he neverplanned but that came like poetry from the zipper mouth. On occasionthey'd laughed at his sermon, and that had made him cruel. But if theycried, and they often did, then he took it in good part, and madecertain the last moment, the very last, was swift and painless.He kicked the woman over onto her back, to see if he could raise herfrom her sleep. And yes, her eyes flickered open slightly.
[CONFLICT][SURPRISE][DIALOGUE]"Good," he said, pointing the gun at her face.As he felt wisdom coming to his lips he heard the growl. It drew hisgaze off the woman for a moment. A soundless wind had risen fromsomewhere, and wasshaking the trees. There was complaint in the ground beneath his

[METAPHOR][SURPRISE][DANGER][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][CHARACTERIZATION][PERSPECTIVE][PLOT][CHARACTER][FLASHBACK][TRANSITION][HORROR]This was the scapegoat; yet not.So much not.The Mask looked down at the woman to confirm that they shared thisvision but she had fallen into unconsciousness. He had to trust whatthe cross-sewn eyes told him, and they told him terrors.
[SURPRISE][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][EMOTION][CHARACTERIZATION][METAPHOR]The sinews of Boone's arms and neck were rippling with light anddarkness; his fingers were growing larger; his face, behind the smokehe exhaled, seemed to be running with dazzling filaments that describeda hidden form within his head which muscle and bone were conformingto.And out of the confusion, a voice. It was not the voice the Maskremembered. No scapegoat's voice, hushed with guilt. It was a yell of
[DANGER][CONFLICT][DEATH][PROBLEM][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE][MONSTER]fury."You're a dead man, Deckerl' the monster cried.The Mask hated that name; that Decker. The man was just some oldflame he'd fucked once in a while. In a heat like this, with the
[DANGER][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][WEAPON][FLASHBACK][MURDER]murder-hard so strong, Of' Button Head could barely remember whetherDr. Decker was alive or dead.Still the monster called him by that name.[DIALOGUE]"You hear me, Decker!"he said.Bastard thing, the Mask thought. Mis-begotten, half aborted bastardthing. He pointed a gun at its heart. It had finished breathing
[PROBLEM][DANGER][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][CONFLICT][DEATH][TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][CHARACTER][CHARACTERIZATION][WEREWOLF]transformations, and stood before its enemy complete, if a thing bornon a butcher's slab could ever be called complete. Mothered by ashe-wolf, fathered by a clown, it was ridiculous to a fault. There'dbe no benediction for this one, the Mask decided. Only phlegm on itshybrid face when it was dead on the ground.
[ACTION][CONFLICT][WEAPON][TRANSITION][SURPRISE]Without further thought he fired. The bullet opened a hole in thecentre of Boone's tee shirt and in the changed flesh beneath but thecreature only grinned.[DIALOGUE]"You tried that already, Decker/ Boone said."Don't you ever learn?[DIALOGUE]""I'm not Decker," the Mask replied, and fired again. Another holeopened up beside the first but there was no blood from either.
[DANGER][CONFLICT][ACTION][TRANSITION][PROBLEM][EXPOSITION][DEATH][SURPRISE][CONTEXT][PERSPECTIVE][WEAPON][MURDER]Boone had begun to advance on the gun. No last, faltering step but asteady approach which the Mask recognized as his own executioner'stread. He could smell the filth of the beast, even through the linenacross his face. It was bitter-sweet, and sickened him to thestomach.
[CONFLICT][MONSTER][DIALOGUE]"Be still," the monster said.[DIALOGUE]"It's quicker that way."The stolen step was insult enough, but to hear the purity of his ownwords from that unnatural throat drove the Mask to distraction. Heshrieked against the cloth, and aimed the gun at Boone's mouth. Butbefore he could blow out the offending tongue Boone's swollen handsreached and took hold of the gun. Even as itwas snatched from him the Mask pulled the trigger, firing againstBoone's hand. The bullets blew off his smallest finger. The
[CONFLICT][DEATH][EMOTION][WEAPON][PROBLEM][DANGER]expression on his face darkened with displeasure. He dragged the gunout of the Mask's hands and flung it away. Then he reached for hismutilator and drew him close.Faced with imminent extinction, the Mask and its wearer divided. OP
[DANGER][CONFLICT][PROBLEM]Button Head did not believe he could ever die. Decker did. His teethgrated against the cage across his mouth, as he began to beg.[DIALOGUE]"Boone ... you don't know what you're doing."He felt the mask tighten over his head in fury at this cowardice but hetalked on, trying to find that even tone he remembered calming this manwith, once upon a time.[DIALOGUE]"You're diseased, Boone."Don't beg, he heard the Mask saying: don't you dare beg.[DIALOGUE]"And you can heal me, can you?"[DIALOGUE]"Oh yes," Decker replied.time."

[CONFLICT][DANGER][EMOTION][PROBLEM][PERSPECTIVE]Too late; Narcisse was already reaching for him, with or withoutBoone's permission. Boone attempted to keep him at bay with his freehand, but the man was too eager for revenge to be blocked. He forcedhimself between Boone and his prey.[DIALOGUE]"Look your last," he grinned, raising his hooked thumbs.But Decker's rummaging hadn't been all panic.

He'dmade long and sober study of his craft. The cut he gave Narcisse was adisembowelling manoeuvre learnt from the Japanese: deep into theintestines and up towards the navel, drawing the blade two-handedagainst the weight of meat. Narcisse cried out more in memory of painthan in pain itself.
[DANGER][ACTION][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][EMOTION][WEAPON]In one smooth motion Decker pulled the big knife out, knowing fromresearches in the field that the well packed contents were bound tofollow. He wasn't wrong. Narcisse's gut uncoiled, falling like aflesh apron to its owner's knees. The wounding which would havedropped a living man to the ground on the spot- merely made a clown ofNarcisse. Howling in disgust at the sight of his innards, he clutched

There wasn't much ground to cover. By the time Boone hadstruggled free of Narcisse the enemy was within sight of unconsecratedearth. Boone gave chase, but before he was even halfway to the gates

[SURPRISE][EMOTION][DANGER][PROBLEM][CONFLICT]Boone knelt beside Lori. Her scent made him dizzy, the softness of herskin beneath his palms was almost overpowering. She was still alive,her pulse strong despite the traumas she must have endured at Decker'shand. Gazing on her gentle face the thought that she might wake andsee him in the shape he'd inherited from Peloquin's bite distressed himbeyond measure. In Decker's presence he'd been proud to call himself a
[SURPRISE][TRANSITION][METAPHOR][CONFLICT][MONSTER]monster, to parade his Nightbreed self. But now, looking at the womanhe had loved, and had been loved by in return for his frailty and hishumanity, he was ashamed.He inhaled, his will making flesh smoke, which his lungs drew back intohis body. It was a process as strange in its ease as its nature. How

The fact thatshe'd enough faith to come looking for him with death on her heels wasmore than any natural man could hope for, and for one such as himself,the true miracle.Her humanity made him proud: of what he'd been, and could still pretendto be.

It was paintedwith stars; however, more fireworks than celestial bodies; Catherinewheels, throwing off sparks as they rolled across the stone heavens.She inclined her head a little. She was in a crypt. There were sealed

To her right, Babette, sitting cross-legged on the floor,watching her intently. The child was dressed completely in black, hereyes catching the candlelight and steadying its flicker. She was not

Were these the first occupants of the cemetery, laid to resthere before the Nightbreed had taken possession? Or were they Breedwho had died from their half-life, caught in the sun, perhaps, orwithered by longing? Whichever, they were in the minority. Most of
[PROBLEM][SURPRISE]the chambers were ten anted by more vital souls, their quarters lit bylamps or candles, or on occasion by the occupant itself: a being thatburned with its own light. Only once did she glimpse such an entity,supine on a mattress in the corner of its boudoir. It was naked,corpulent and sexless, its sagging body a motley of dark oily skin andlarval eruptions which seeped phosphorescence, soaking its simple bed.It seemed every other doorway let on to some fragment as mysterious,her response to them problematic as the tableaux that inspired it. Was
[CONFLICT][SURPRISE][EMOTION][VAMPIRE]it simply disgust that made her stomach flip, seeing the stigma tic infull flood, with sharp-toothed adherents sucking noisily at her wounds;or excitement, confronting the legend of the vampire in the flesh? Andwhat was she to make of the man whose body broke into birds when he sawherwatching, or the dog-headed painter who turned from his fresco andbeckoned her to join his apprentice mixing paint? Or the machinebeasts running up the walls on caliper legs? After a dozen corridorsshe no longer knew horror from fascination. Perhaps she'd never
[TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][CONFLICT][EMOTION][DANGER]known.She might have spent days lost and seeing the sights, but luck orinstinct brought her close enough to Boone that further progress wasblocked. It was Lylesburg's shadow that appeared before her, seemingto step from the solid wall.[DIALOGUE]"You may go no further."[DIALOGUE]"I intend to find Boone/ she told him."You're not to blame in this,[DIALOGUE]" Lylesburg said. "That's completelyunderstood. But you must in turn understand: what Boone did has put us

But her hands sank into the darkness he wore and touchedthe wall behind him. He had no substance. He couldn't keep her from

A quick backward glance confirmed what she'd already guessed: thatLylesburg had made no attempt to follow. She turned a corner, andanother, the undercurrents in the voice still multiplying, until shewas walking against them as if in a high wind, head down, shouldershunched.There were no chambers now along the passageway; and consequently nolights. There was a glow up ahead however fitful and cold, but brightenough to illuminate both the ground she stumbled over, which was bareearth, and the silvery frost on the walls.
[SURPRISE][CONFLICT][DIALOGUE]"Boone?"she shouted.[DIALOGUE]"Are you there?Boone?"After what Lylesburg had said she didn't hope too hard for an answer,but she got one. His voice came to meet her from the core of light andsound ahead. But all she heard through the din was:"Don't'Don't what?she wondered.
[CONFLICT]Don't come any further?Don't leave me here?She slowed her pace, and called again, but the noise the Baptiser wasmaking virtually drowned out the sound of her own voice, never mind areply. Having come so far, she had to go forward, not knowing if hiscall had been a warning or not.
[EMOTION][PROBLEM][TRANSITION][CONFLICT]Ahead, the passageway became a slope a steepslope. She halted at the top, and squinted into the brightness. Thiswas Baphomet's hole, no doubt of that. The din it was making erodedthe walls of the slope and carried the dust up into her face. Tears
[DANGER][SURPRISE]began to fill her eyes to wash the grit away, but it kept coming.Deafened by voice, blinded by dust, she teetered on the lip of theslope, unable to go forward or back.Suddenly, the Baptiser fell silent, the layers of sound all dying atonce, and completely.The hush that followed was more alarming than the din that had precededit. Had it shut its mouth because it knew it had a trespasser in its
[SURPRISE]midst? She held her breath, afraid to utter a sound.At the bottom of the slope was a sacred place, she had not theslightest doubt of that. Standing in the great cathedrals of Europewith her mother, years before, gazing at the windows and the altars,she'd felt nothing approaching the surge of recognition she felt now.
[CONFLICT][EMOTION][PROBLEM][SURPRISE]Nor, in all her life dreaming or awake had such contradictory impulsesrun in her. She wanted to flee the place with a passion wanted toforsake it and forget it; and yet it summoned. It was not Boone'spresence there that called her, but the pull of the holy, or theunholy, or the two in one; and it wouldn't be resisted.Her tears had cleared the dust from her eyes now. She had no excuse
[FLASHBACK]but cowardice to remain where she stood. She began down the slope. Itwas a descent of thirty yards, but she'd covered no more than a thirdof it when a familiar figure staggered into view at the bottom.The last time she'd seen Boone had been over ground as he emerged toconfront Decker. In the seconds before she'd passed out she'd seen him
[SURPRISE][METAPHOR][CHARACTER][CONFLICT][CHARACTERIZATION][FLASHBACK][PROBLEM]as never before: like a man who'd forgotten pain and defeat entirely.Not so now. He could barely hold himself upright.She whispered his name, the word gathering weight as it tumbledtowards him.
[EMOTION][SURPRISE][HORROR]He heard, and raised his head towards her. Even in his worst times,when she'd rocked him and held him to keep the terrors at bay, she'dnot seen such grief on his face as she saw now. Tears coming andcoming, his features so crumpled with sorrow they were like a baby's.She began the descent again, every sound her feet made, every tinybreath she took, multiplied by the acoustics of the slope.
Seeing her approach he left off holding himself up to wave her away,but in doing so lost his only means of support and fell heavily. Shepicked up her pace, careless now of the noise she was making. Whateverpower occupied the pit at the bottom it knew she was there. Mostlikely it knew her history. In a way she hoped it did. She wasn't
[CONFLICT]afraid of its judgement. She had loving reason for her trespass; shecame weaponless, and alone. If Baphomet was indeed the architect ofMidian then it understood vulnerability, and would not act against her.She was within five yards of Boone by now. He was attempting to roll
[CONFLICT]himself onto his back.[DIALOGUE]"Wait!"she said, distressed by his desperation.He didn't look her way, however. It was Baphomet his eyes went to,once he got onto his back. Her gaze went with his, into a room withwalls of frozen earth, and a floor the same, the latter split fromcorner to corner, and a fissure opened in it from which a flame columnrose four or five times the size of a man. There was bitter cold off

Insteadits innards churned upon themselves, turning over and over some freightof stuff which she failed to recognize at first, but her appalled starerapidly interpreted.There was a body in the fire, hacked limb from limb, human enough thatshe recognized it as flesh, but nomore than that.a transgressor.

This diced and divided thing. Seeing its face, she

[SURPRISE][CONFLICT][DANGER][HORROR]hatred, or their sum, beyond the beautiful or the monstrous, or theirsum. Beyond, finally, her mind's power to comprehend or catalogue. Inthe instant she looked away from it she had already blanked everyfraction of the sight from conscious memory and locked it where notorment or entreaty would ever make her look again.She hadn't known her own strength till the frenzy to be out of itspresence had her hauling Boone to his feet and dragging him up theslope. He could do little to help her. The time he'd spent in the
[SURPRISE][METAPHOR][PERSPECTIVE][FLASHBACK]Baptiser's presence had driven all but the rags of power from hismuscles. It seemed to Lori that it took an age staggering up to thehead of the slope, the flame's icy light throwing their shadows beforethem like prophecies.The passageway above was deserted. She had half expected Lylesburg tobe in wait somewhere with more solid cohorts, but the silence of thechamber below had spread throughout the tunnel. Once she'd hauled

One of his fingers was missing,she saw, the wound fresh. He seemed indifferent to it, however, so sheasked no questions but concentrated on encouraging him to move. He was
reluctant, almost sullen in the aftermath of high emotion, but shechivvied him along, until they reached a steep stairway which took themup through one of the mausoleums and into the night.The air smelt of distance after the confinement of the earth, butrather than linger to enjoy it, she insisted they get out of thecemetery, threading their way through the maze of tombs to the gate.There Boone halted.The car's just outside," she said.

[SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE]The rest of him was so cold; so much still a part of Midian's darkness.She didn't wonder at that. After all this night (and the days that hadpreceded it) had brought, she was surprised to find such capacity forhope in herself. But it was there, strong as a heart-beat, and shewouldn't let the fears she'd learned from the Breed undercut it.
[SURPRISE]"I love you, Boone/ she said, not expecting an answer.Maybe in time he'd speak up. If not words of love, at least ofexplanation. And if he didn't, or couldn't, it was not so bad. She
had better than explanations. She had the fact of him, the flesh ofhim. His body was solid in her arms. Whatever claim Midian had uponhis memories Lylesburg had been perfectly explicit: he would never beallowed to return there. Instead he would be beside her again atnight, his simple presence more precious than any display of passion.
[CONFLICT][TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE]And as time went by she'd persuade him from the torments of Midian, asshe had from the self-inflicted torments of his lunacy. She hadn'tfailed in that, as Decker's deceits had convinced her she had. Boonehad not concealed a secret life from her; he was innocent. As was she.
Innocents both, which fact had brought them alive through thisprecarious night and into the safety of the day.PART FOURSAINTS AND SINNERS"You want my advice?Kiss the Devil, eat the worm'Jan de Mooy Another matter; or, Man remadeThe TollThe sun rose like a stripper, keeping its glory jell covered by cloudtill it seemed there'd be no _how at all, then casting its rags off oneby one. As the light grew so did Boone's discomfort. Rummaging in the
glove compartment Lori rooted out a pair of sunglasses, which Boone puton to keep the worst of the light from his sensitized eyes. Even thenhe had to keep his head down, his face averted from the brighteningEast.They spoke scarcely at all. Lori was too concerned to keep her wearymind on the task of driving, and Boone made no attempt to break thesilence. He had thoughts of his own, but none that he could have
articulated to the woman at his side. In the past Lori had meant agreat deal to him, he knew, but making contact with those feelings nowwas beyond him. He felt utterly removed from his life with her, indeedfrom life at all. Through the years of his sickness he'd clung alwaysto the threads of consequence he saw in living: how one action resultedin another; this feeling in that. He'd got through, albeit with
[DANGER][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][MONSTER]stumbling steps, by seeing how the path behind him became the oneahead. Now he could see neither forward nor backward, except dimly.Clearest in his head, Baphomet, the Divided One. Of all Midian'soccupants it was the most powerful and the most vulnerable, taken apartby ancient enemiesbut preserved, suffering and suffering, in the flame Lylesburg hadcalled the Trial Fire. Boone had gone into Baphomet's pit hoping to
[EMOTION][CONFLICT][CHARACTER][PERSPECTIVE][FLASHBACK][PROBLEM][DANGER][HORROR]argue his case; but it was the Baptiser that had spoken, oracles from asevered head. He could not now remember its pronouncements but he knewthe news had been grim.Amongst his memories of the whole and the human, sharpest was that ofDecker. He could piece together several fragments of their sharedhistory, and knew it should enrage him, but he could not find it inhimself to hate the man who'd led him to Midian's deeps, anymore thanhe could love the woman who'd brought him out of them. They were part
[METAPHOR][MONSTER]of some other biography; not quite his.What Lori understood of his condition he didn't know, but he suspectedshe remained for the most part ignorant. Whatever she guessed, sheseemed content to accept him as he was, and in a simple, animal way heneeded her presence too much to risk telling her the truth, assumingthat he could have found the words. He was as much and as little as hewas. Man. Monster. Dead. Alive. In Midian he'd seen all these
[CONFLICT][CHARACTER][PROBLEM][HAUNTED HOUSE]states in a single creature: they were, most likely, all true of him.The only people who might have helped him understand how suchcontraries could co-exist were behind him, in the necropolis. They'donly begun the long, long process of educating him in Midian's historywhen he'd defied them. Now he was exiled from their presence forever,and he'd never know.
[PROBLEM][CONFLICT][DANGER][METAPHOR][SURPRISE][DEATH][PERSPECTIVE][CONTEXT][TRANSITION][EXPOSITION][FLASHBACK][CHARACTERIZATION][CHARACTER][SETTING]There was a paradox. Lylesburg had warned him clearly enough as they'dstood together in the tunnels and listened to Lori's cries for help;told him unequivocally that if he broke cover he broke his covenantwith the Breed.[DIALOGUE]"Remember what you are now he'd said. "You can't save her, and keepour refuge. So you have to let her die."Yet he couldn't.
[DANGER][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK][TRANSITION][PROBLEM]Though Lori belonged in anotherlife, a life he'd lost forever, he couldn't leave her to the fiend.What that meant, if anything, was beyond his capacity to grasp rightnow. These few circling thoughts aside he was sealed in the moment hewas living, and the next moment, and the moment after that; movingsecond by second through his life as the car moved over the road,ignorant of the place it had been and blind to where it was headed.They were almost within sight of the Sweetgrass Inn when it occurred toLori that if Sheryl's body had been found at the Hudson Bay Sunsetthere was a chance their destination would already be crawling withpolice.
She stopped the car.[DIALOGUE]"What's wrong?"Boone asked.She told him.[DIALOGUE]"Perhaps it'd be safer if I went there alone she said.I'll get my things and come back for you."[DIALOGUE]"No,"he said.[DIALOGUE]"If it's safe"That's not so good.[DIALOGUE]"She couldn't see his eyes behind the sunglasses, but his voice carriedfear in it."I'll be quick,[DIALOGUE]" she said."No.[DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE]""Why not?""It's better we stay together,[DIALOGUE]" he replied. He put his hands over hisface, as he had at Midian's gates. "Don't leave me alone," he said,
[SURPRISE]his voice hushed. [DIALOGUE]"I don't know where I am, Lori. I don't even knowwho I am. Stay with me."She leaned over to him, and kissed the back of his hand. He let bothfall from his face. She kissed his cheek, then his mouth. They drove
[SURPRISE][PROBLEM]on together to the Inn.In fact her fears proved groundless. If Sheryl's body had indeed beenlocated overnight which was perhaps unlikely given its location- noconnection had been made with the Inn. Indeed not only were there nopolice to bar their way there was little sign of life at all. Only a
dog yapping in one of the upper rooms, and a baby crying somewhere.Even the lobby was deserted, the desk clerk too occupied with theMorning Show to keep his post. The sound of laughter and musicfollowed them through the hall and up the stairs to the first floor.Despite the ease of it, by the time they'd reached the room Lori'shands were trembling so much she could scarcely align the key with thelock. She turned to Boone for assistance, only to discover that he was
[SURPRISE][TRANSITION]no longer close behind her but lingering at the top of the stairs,looking back and forth along the corridor. Again, she cursed thesunglasses, which prevented her reading his feelings with anycertainty. At least until he backed against the wall, his fingersseeking some purchase though there was none to be had.[DIALOGUE]"What's the problem, Boone?"There's nobody here,[DIALOGUE]" he returned."Well that's good for us, isn't it?[DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE]""But I can smell...""What can you smell?"He shook his head.
[DIALOGUE]"Tell me."[DIALOGUE]"I smell blood."[DIALOGUE]"Boone?"[DIALOGUE]"I smell so much blood."[DIALOGUE]"Where?Where from?"He made no answer, nor did he look her way, but stared off down thecorridor.[DIALOGUE]"I'll be quick," she told him.back with you.[DIALOGUE]""Just stay where you are, and I'll beGoing down on her haunches she clumsily fitted key to lock, then stoodup and opened the door. There was no scent of blood from the room,only the stale perfumeof the previous night. It reminded her instantly of Sheryl, and of
[FLASHBACK]the good times they'd had together, even in the midst of such bad. Lessthan twenty-four hours ago she'd been laughing in this very room, andtalking of her killer as the man of her dreams.Thinking of which, Lori looked back towards Boone. He was stillpressed against the wall, as if it was the only way to be certain theworld wasn't toppling. Leaving him to it, she stepped into the room,and went about her packing. First into the bathroom, to collect up her
[SURPRISE][PROBLEM][TRANSITION]toiletries, and then back into the bedroom to gather her strewnclothes. It was only as she put her bag on the bed to pack it that shesaw the crack in the wall. It was as if something had hit it from theother side, very hard. The plaster had come away in clods, andlittered the floor between the twin beds. She stared at the crack a
[SURPRISE][CONFLICT][ACTION][PROBLEM][TRANSITION]moment. Had the party got so riotous they'd started throwing thefurniture around?Curious, she crossed to the wall. It was little more than aplasterboard partition, and the impact from the far side had actuallyopened a hole in it. She pulled a piece of loose plaster away and put
[PERSPECTIVE][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][EMOTION][GORE]her eye to the aperture.The curtains were still drawn in the room beyond, but the sun wasstrong enough to penetrate, lending the air an ochre gloom. Lastnight's party must have been even more debauched than the one the nightbefore, she thought. Wine stains on the walls, and the celebrantsstill asleep on the floor.
[TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][EXPOSITION][EMOTION][CHARACTERIZATION][CONTEXT][MURDER]But the smell: it wasn't wine.She stepped back from the wall, her stomach turning.Fruit spilled no such juice Another step.flesh did. And if it was blood she smelt then it was blood she saw,
[DANGER][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][METAPHOR][CONFLICT][EXPOSITION][PERSPECTIVE][MURDER]and if it was blood she saw then the sleepers were not sleeping,because who lies down in an abattoir? Only the dead.She went quickly to the door.Down the corridorBoone was no long standing, but crouched against the wall, hugging hisknees. His face, as he turned to her, was full of distressing tics.
[CONFLICT][EMOTION][DANGER][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][TRANSITION][EXPOSITION][CONTEXT][CHARACTERIZATION][MURDER][DIALOGUE]"Get up," she told him.[DIALOGUE]"I smell blood he said softly."You're right.So get up.Quickly.Help me."
[FLASHBACK][CONFLICT]But he was rigid; rooted to the floor. She knew this posture of old:hunched in a corner, shivering like a beaten dog. In the past she'dhad comforting words to offer, but there was no time for such solacenow. Perhaps someone had survived the blood-bath in the next room. If
[CONFLICT][DEATH][DANGER][EMOTION][ACTION][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][TRANSITION][EXPOSITION][CONTEXT][MURDER]so, she had to help, with Boone or without. She turned the handle ofthe slaughterhouse door, and opened it.As the smell of death came out to meet her Boone started to moan.'... blood..."
[MURDER]she heard him say.Everywhere, blood. She stood and stared for a full minute beforeforcing herself over the threshold to search for some sign of life. Buteven the most cursory glance at each of the corpses confirmed that thesame nightmare had claimed all six. She knew his name too. He'd left
[CONFLICT][PROBLEM][WEAPON][DANGER][DEATH][MURDER]his mark; wiping their features out with his knives the way he hadSheryl's. Three of the six he'd caught in flagrante delicto. Two menand a woman, partially undressed and slumped over each other on thebed, their entanglements fatal. The others had died lying in spiritsodden comas around the room, most likely without even waking. Hand
[TRANSITION]over her mouth to keep the smell out and the sobs in, she retreatedfrom the room, the taste of her stomach in her throat. As she steppedout into the corridor her peripheral vision caught sight of Boone. Hewasn't sitting any longer, but moving purposefully down the passagewaytowards her.[DIALOGUE]"We have ... to get... out," she said.He made no sign that he'd even heard her voice, but moved past hertowards the open door.
[CONFLICT][TRANSITION][MURDER][DIALOGUE]"Decker ..."she said,[DIALOGUE]"... it was Decker."He still offered no reply.[DIALOGUE]"Talk to me, Boone."He murmured something [DIALOGUE]"He could still be here," she said. [DIALOGUE]"We have tohurry." but he was already stepping inside to view the carnage atcloser quarters. She had no desire to look again. Instead shereturned to the adjacent room to finish her hurried packing. As she
[EMOTION][CONFLICT][DANGER]went about it she heard Boone moving around the room next door, hisbreathing almost pained. Afraid of leaving him on his own for any timeshe gave up on trying to collect all but the most telling items thephotographs and an address book chief amongst them and that done wentout into the corridor.The din of police sirens was there to meet her, their panic fuellinghers. Though the cars were still some way off she couldn't doubt theirdestination. Louder with every whoop, they were coming to the Sweet
[CONFLICT][MURDER]grass, hot for the guilty.She called for Boone.[DIALOGUE]"I'm finished!"she said.[DIALOGUE]"Let's get going!"There was no reply from the room.[DIALOGUE]"Boone?"She went to the door trying to keep her eyes off the bodies. Boone wason the far side of the room, silhouetted against the curtains. Hisbreath was no longer audible.
[DIALOGUE]"Do you hear me?"she said.He didn't move a muscle. She could read no expression on his face itwas too dark but she could see that he'd taken the sunglasses off.[DIALOGUE]"We haven't got much time," she said.[DIALOGUE]"Will you come on?"As she spoke, he exhaled. It was no normal breath; she knew that evenbefore the smoke started from his throat. As it came he raised his
[CONFLICT][EMOTION][DANGER]hands to his mouth asif to stop it, but at his chin they halted and began to convulse.[DIALOGUE]"Get out," he said, on the same breath that brought the smoke.She couldn't move, or even take her eyes off him. The murk was not sothick she couldn't see the change coming, his face re-ordering itselfbehind the veil, light burning in his arms and climbing his neck inwaves to melt the bones of his head.'/ don't want you to see," he begged her, his voice deteriorating.
[DANGER][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][CHARACTER][HORROR]Too late. She'd seen the man with fire in his flesh at Midian; and thedog-headed painter, and more besides: Boone had all their diseases inhis system, undoing his humanity before her eyes. He was the stuff ofnightmares. No wonder he howled, head thrown back as his face wasforfeited.
The sound was almost cancelled by the sirens, however. They could beno more than a minute from the door. If she went now she might stilloutpace them.In front of her, Boone was done, or undone, entirely. He lowered his
[SURPRISE][DEATH][TRANSITION][DANGER][CONFLICT]head, remnants of smoke evaporating around him. Then he began to move,his new sinews bearing him lightly, like an athlete.Even now she hoped he understood his jeopardy and was coming to thedoor to be saved. But no. It was to the dead he moved, where the

He let the meat drop a little and looked up at her.He still had his blue eyes, and they were full of tears.

Then he forgot her, and lifted the human meat to his lips.She didn't watch his jaws close on it, but the sound reached her, andit was all she could do to stay conscious, hearing him tear and chew.
[DANGER][TRANSITION][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][ACTION][SURPRISE][MONSTER]From below, brakes screeching, doors slamming. In moments they'd havethe building surrounded, blocking any hope of escape; moments laterthey'd be coming up the stairs. She had no choice but to leave thebeast to its hunger. Boone was lost to her.
[CONFLICT][TRANSITION][RESOLUTION][DANGER]She elected not to return the way they'd come, but to take the backstairs. The decision was well made; even as she turned the corner ofthe upper corridor she heard the police at the other end, rapping ondoors. Almost immediately afterwards she heard the sound of forcedentry from above, and exclamations of disgust. This couldn't be onfinding Boone,he wasn't behind a locked door. Clearly they'd
[SURPRISE]discovered something else on the upper corridor. She didn't need tohear the morning news to know what. Her instinct told her loud andstrong how thorough Decker had been the night before. There was a dogalive somewhere in the building, and he'd overlooked a baby in hisheat, but the rest he'd taken. He'd just come straight back from his
[SURPRISE][DANGER][DEATH][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][ACTION][TRANSITION][EMOTION][MURDER]failure at Midian and killed every living soul in the place.Above and below the investigating officers were discovering that veryfact, and the shock of it made them incompetent. She had no difficultyslipping out of the building and away into the scrub at the back. Onlyas she reached the cover of the trees did one of the cops appear roundthe corner of the building, but even he had other business than thesearch. Once out of sight of his colleagues he threw up his breakfast
in the dirt, then scrupulously wiped his mouth with his handkerchiefand went back to the job in hand.Secure that they wouldn't start a search of the exterior until they'dfinished inside, she waited. Whatwould they do to Boone when they found him? Shoot him down, mostlikely. There was nothing she could think of to prevent it. But the
minutes passed, and though there were shouts from within, there was nosound of gunfire. They must have found him by now. Maybe she'd get abetter grasp of what had happened from the front of the building.The Inn was shielded on three sides by shrubbery and trees. It wasn't
[CONFLICT][PROBLEM][ACTION][DANGER][WEAPON][TRANSITION]difficult to make her way through the undergrowth to the flank, hermovement countered by an influx of rifle-bearing cops from the front,to take up stations at the rear exit. Two more patrol cars werearriving at the scene. The first contained further armed troopers, thesecond a selection of interested parties. Two ambulance vansfollowed.
[PERSPECTIVE][EMOTION]They'll need more, she thought grimly.A lot more.Though the congregation of so many cars and armed men had attracted anaudience of passers by, the scene at the front was subdued, evencasual. There were as many men standing and staring at the building asmoving to enter and explore it. They grasped the point now. The place
[METAPHOR][DEATH][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][DANGER][HELL]was a two storey coffin. More people had probably been murdered herein one night than had died by violence in Shere Neck over its entirelife. Anyone here this bright morning was part of history. Theknowledge hushed them.
[CONFLICT][SURPRISE]Her attention went from the witnesses to a knot of people standingaround the lead car. A break in the circle of debaters allowed for aglimpse of the man at its centre. Sober-suited, polished spectaclesglinting in the sun. Decker held court. What was he arguing for: a
[CONFLICT]chance to coax his patient out into the open air? If that was hispitch he was being overruled by the only member of the circle inuniform, Shere Neck's Police Chief presumably, who dismissed his appealwith a wave of the hand, then stepped out of the argument entirely.From a distance it was impossible to read Decker's response, but heseemed perfectly in controlof himself, leaning to speak into the ear of one of the others, whonodded sagely at the whispered remark.Last night Lori had seen Decker the madman unmasked. Now she wanted to
[DANGER][WEAPON][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][METAPHOR]unmask him again. Strip away this facade of civilized concern. Buthow? If she stepped out of hiding and challenged him tried to begin toexplain all that she'd seen and experienced in the last twenty fourhours they'd be measuring her up for a strait-jacket before she'd takena second breath.
[SURPRISE][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][CHARACTER][PERSPECTIVE][METAPHOR][CHARACTERIZATION][DANGER]He was the one in the well cut suit, with the doctorate and the friendsin high places; he was the man, the voice of reason and analysis, whileshe a mere woman! -what credentials did she have? -lover of a lunaticand a sometime beast? Decker's midnight face was quite secure.
[CONFLICT][ACTION]There was a sudden eruption of shouts from inside the building. On anorder from their chief the troopers outside levelled their weapons atthe front door; the rest retired a few yards. Two cops, pistols aimedat someone inside, backed out of the door. A beat later, Boone, hishands cuffed in front of him, was pushed into the light. It near
[CONFLICT][DANGER][SURPRISE][MURDER]blinded him. He tried to turn from its brilliance, back into theshadows, but there were two armed men following, who pressed himforward.There was no sign remaining of the creature Lori had seen him become,but there was ample reminder of his hunger. Blood glued his tee shirtto his chest, and spattered his face and arms.There was some applause from the audience, uniformed and otherwise, atthe sight of the killer chained. Decker joined it, nodding and
[CONFLICT][EMOTION][RELIEF][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][DANGER][HORROR]smiling, as Boone was led away, head averted from the sun, and put intothe back of one of the cars.Lori watched the scene with so many feelings grappling for herattention. Relief that Boone had not been shot on sight, mingled withhorror at what she nowknew he was; rage at Decker's performance, and disgust at those whowere taken in by it.So many masks. Was she the only one who had no secret life; no other
[PROBLEM][SURPRISE][TRANSITION]self in marrow or mind? If not, then perhaps she had no place in thisgame of appearances-, perhaps Boone and Decker were the true lovershere, swapping blows and faces but necessary to each other.And she'd hugged this man, demanded he embrace her, put her lips to hisface. She could never do that again, knowing what lay in wait behindhis lips, behind his eyes. She could never kiss the beast.
[SURPRISE][METAPHOR][PROBLEM][DANGER]So why did the thought make her heart hammer?Now or Never[DIALOGUE]"That are you telling me?Some kind of V V cult?"That there's more of these people involved?Decker drew breath to deliver his warning about Midian over again. Thetroopers called their Chief everything but his name behind his back.
[DANGER][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][PLOT][SURPRISE][TRANSITION]Five minutes in his presence and Decker knew why, ten and he wasplotting the man's dismemberment. But not today. The day he neededIrwin Eigerman: and Eigerman, did he but know it, needed him. Whiledaylight lasted Midian was vulnerable, but they had to be swift. It
[CONFLICT][DANGER]was already one o'clock. Nightfall might still be a good distanceaway, but so was Midian. To get a task force out there to uproot theplace was the work of several hours, and every minute lost to argumentwas a minute lost to action.[DIALOGUE]"Beneath the cemetery," Decker said, beginning again at the place he'dbegun half an hour before.Eigerman scarcely made a pretence of listening. His euphoria had
[DANGER][PROBLEM]increased in direct proportion to the number of bodies brought out ofthe Sweetgrass Inn, a count which presently stood at sixteen. He hadhopes for more. The only human survivor was a year-old baby found in atumble of blood-soaked sheets. He'd taken her out of the buildinghimself, for the benefit of the cameras. Tomorrow the country would
[CONFLICT][DANGER][CHARACTERIZATION][SURPRISE][ACTION][PROBLEM][HORROR]know his name.None of this would have been possible withoutDecker's tip off, of course, which was why he was humouring the man,though at this stage in proceedings, with interviewers and flashlightscalling, he was damned if he was going to go after a few freaks wholiked corpses for company, which was what Decker was suggesting hedo.He took out his comb and began to rake over his thinning crop, in thehope of fooling the cameras. He was no beauty, he knew. Should it
[METAPHOR][CHARACTERIZATION][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE]ever slip his mind he had Annie to remind him. You look like a sow,she was fond of remarking, usually before bedtime on a Saturday night.But then people saw what they wanted to see. After today, he'd looklike a hero.
[CONFLICT][FLASHBACK][DANGER][METAPHOR][EMOTION][SURPRISE][CHARACTERIZATION][TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][PROBLEM][CHARACTER][CONTEXT][WEAPON][DIALOGUE]"Are you listening?"[DIALOGUE]"I hear you.Decker said.There's folks grave robbing."Not grave robbing.I hear you.[DIALOGUE]"Not folks."[DIALOGUE]"Freaks," Eigerman said.[DIALOGUE]"Not the likes of these."Sweet grass are you?[DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE]""I seen 'em.""You're not saying any of them were at the[DIALOGUE]"No."[DIALOGUE]"We've got the man responsible right here?"[DIALOGUE]"Yes."[DIALOGUE]"Under lock and key."[DIALOGUE]"Yes.But there are others in Midian."[DIALOGUE]"Murderers?"[DIALOGUE]"Probably."[DIALOGUE]"You're not sure?"[DIALOGUE]"Just get some of your people out there."[DIALOGUE]"What's the hurry?"[DIALOGUE]"If I told you once I told you a dozen times."[DIALOGUE]"So tell me again."[DIALOGUE]"They have to be rounded up by daylight."[DIALOGUE]"What are they? Some kind of bloodsuckers?"[DIALOGUE]"That what they are?"He chuckled to himself."In a manner of speaking Decker replied.
[DIALOGUE]"Well, in a manner of speaking I gotta tell you, it'sgonna have to wait.leave them begging."Fuck polite.town?[DIALOGUE]"I got people want to interview me, doctor.It's not polite."You've got deputies, haven't you?Can'tOr is this a one copEigerman clearly bridled at this.[DIALOGUE]"I've got deputies."[DIALOGUE]"Then may I suggest you dispatch some of them to Midian?"[DIALOGUE]"To do what?"[DIALOGUE]"Dig around."[DIALOGUE]"That's probably consecrated ground, mister," Eigerman replied. [DIALOGUE]"That'sholy."[DIALOGUE]"What's under it isn't," Decker replied, with a gravity that hadEigerman silenced. [DIALOGUE]"You trusted me once, Irwin," he said. "And you
[DANGER][TRANSITION][METAPHOR][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][HORROR]caught a killer. Trust me again. You have to turn Midian upsidedown."There had been terrors, yes, but the old imperatives remained the same:the body had to eat, had to sleep. After leaving the Sweetgrass Inn
Lori satisfied the first of these, wandering the streets until shefound a suitably anonymous and busy store, then buying a collection ofinstant gratification foods: doughnuts, custard filled and dutch apple,chocolate milk, cheese. Then she sat in the sun and ate, her numbedmind unable to think much beyond the simple business of biting, chewingand swallowing. The food made her so sleepy she couldn't have deniedher lids falling if she'd tried. When she woke her side of the street,which had been bathed in sunshine, was in shadow. The stone step was
[PERSPECTIVE]chilly, and her body ached. But the food and the rest, howeverprimitive, had done her some good. Her thought processes were a littlemore in order. She had little cause for optimism, that was certain,but the situation had been bleaker when she'd first come through thistown, on her way to find the spot where Boone had fallen. Then she'd
[SURPRISE][HORROR]believed the man she loved was dead; it had been a widow's pilgrimage.Now at least he was alive, though God alone knew what horror,contracted in the tombs of Midian, possessed him. Given that fact, itwas perhaps good that he was safe in the hands of the law, the slowprocess of which would give her time to think their problems through.Most urgent of those, a way to unmask Decker. No-one could kill so
[DANGER][METAPHOR][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK][PROBLEM][MURDER]many without leaving some trace of evidence. Perhaps back at therestaurant, where he'd murdered Sheryl. She doubted he'd lead thepolice there as he'd led them to the Inn. It would seem too likecomplicity with the accused, knowing all the murder sites. He'd wait
for the other corpse to be found by accident, knowing the crime wouldbe ascribed to Boone. Which meant perhaps the site was untouched, andshe might still find some clue that would incriminate him; or at veryleast open a crack in that pristine face of his.Returning to where Sheryl had died, and where she'd endured Decker'sprovocations, would be no picnic, but it was the only alternative todefeat she had.She went quickly. By daylight, she had a hope of getting up the
[PERSPECTIVE][DANGER]courage to step through that burnt out door. By night it would beanother matter.Decker watched as Eigerman briefed his deputies, four men who sharedwith their Chief the looks of bullies made good.[DIALOGUE]"Now I trust our source," he said magnanimously, throwing a look backat Decker, 'and if he tells me something bad's going down in Midian,then I thinkthat's worth listening to.what you can see."
I want you to dig around a little.See[DIALOGUE]"What exactly are we looking for?" one of the number wanted to know.His name was Pettine. A forty-year old with the wide, empty face of acomedian's foil; and a voice too loud, and a belly too big.

"If there's anything to find there, they'll find it.[DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE]""Good enough.""I'm going to see the prisoner. You want to come?[DIALOGUE]" I've seen as muchof Boone as I ever want to see." [DIALOGUE]"No problem," Eigerman said, and leftDecker to his calculations.He'd almost elected to go with the troopers to Midian but there was toomuch work to do here preparing the ground for the revelations ahead.
[CONFLICT][PROBLEM][DANGER]There would be revelations. Though so far Boone had declined torespond to even the simplest enquiries, he'd break his silenceeventually, and when he did Decker would have questions asked of him.There was no chance any of Boone's accusations could stick the man hadbeen found with human meat in his mouth, bloodied from head to foot butthere were elementsof recent events that confounded even Decker, and until every variablein the scenario had been pinned down and understood he would fret.What, for instance, had happened to Boone? How had the scapegoat
[SURPRISE][DANGER][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][FLASHBACK][TRANSITION][MONSTER]filled with bullets and filed as dead become the ravening monster he'dalmost lost his life to the night before? Boone had even claimed hewas dead, for Christ's sake and in the chill of the moment Decker hadalmost shared the psychosis. Now he saw more clearly. Eigerman wasright. They were freaks, albeit stranger than the usual stuff. Things
[CONFLICT][SURPRISE][DANGER]in de france of nature, to be poked from under their stones and soakedin gasoline. He'd happily strike the match himself.[DIALOGUE]"Decker?"He turned from his thoughts to find Eigerman closing the door on thebabble of journalists outside. All trace of his former confidence hadfled. He was sweating profusely.
[CONFLICT][DIALOGUE]"OK.What the fuck's going on?"[DIALOGUE]"Do we have a problem, Irwin?"[DIALOGUE]"Shit alive, do we have a problem."[DIALOGUE]"Boone?"[DIALOGUE]"Of course Boone."[DIALOGUE]"What?"[DIALOGUE]"The doctors have just looked him over.That's procedure."[DIALOGUE]"And?"[DIALOGUE]"How many times did you shoot him?Three, four?"[DIALOGUE]"Yeah, maybe."[DIALOGUE]"Well the bullets are still in him."[DIALOGUE]"I'm not that surprised," Decker said. [DIALOGUE]"I told you we're not dealingwith ordinary people here. What are the doctors saying? He should bedead?"[DIALOGUE]"He is dead."[DIALOGUE]"When?"[DIALOGUE]"I don't mean lying down dead, shithead," Eigermansaid. [DIALOGUE]"I mean sitting in my fucking cell dead.isn't beating."I mean his heartThat's impossible.[DIALOGUE]""I've got two fuckers telling me the man is walking dead, and invitingme to listen for myself. You wanna tell me about that, doctor?"DeliriumHe stood across the street from the burnt out estaurant, and watched itfor five minutes, to see if there was any sign of activity. There was
[SURPRISE][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][PERSPECTIVE][DANGER][HELL]none. Only now, in the full light of day, did she realize just how rundown this neighbourhood was. Decker had chosen well. The chance ofanyone having seen him enter or leave the place the night before wasmost likely zero. Even in the middle of the afternoon no pedestrian
[FLASHBACK][PERSPECTIVE][EMOTION][CONTEXT][TRANSITION][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][CHARACTER]passed along the street in either direction, and the few vehicles thatused the thoroughfare were speeding on their way to somewhere morepromising. Something about the scene perhaps the heat of the sun, incontrast to Sheryl's unmarked grave brought her solitary adventure inMidian back to her; or more particularly, her encounter with Babette.It wasn't just her mind's eye which conjured the girl. It seemed herwhole body was reliving their first meeting. She could feel the weight
[EMOTION][DANGER][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK][PROBLEM][MONSTER]of the beast she'd picked up from beneath the tree against her breast.Its laboured breathing was in her ears, its bitter sweetness prickedher nostrils.The sensations came with such force they almost constituted asummoning: past jeopardy signalling present. She seemed to see thechild looking up at her from her arms, though she'd never carriedBabette in human form. The child's mouth was opening and closing,
[SURPRISE][EMOTION][PERSPECTIVE][METAPHOR][DANGER][HORROR]forming an appeal Lori could not read from lips alone.Then, like a cinema screen blanked out in mid movie, the imagesdisappeared, and she was left with only one set of sensations: thestreet, the sun, the burnt out building ahead.There was no purpose in putting off the evil moment any longer. Shecrossed the street, mounted the sidewalk, and without allowing herselfto slow her step by a beat stepped through the carbonized door frameinto the murk beyond. So quickly dark! So quickly cold! One step out
[TRANSITION][SURPRISE][DANGER][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][FLASHBACK][PERSPECTIVE]of the sunlight, and she was in another world. Her pace slowed alittle now, as she negotiated the maze of debris that lay between frontdoor and the kitchen. Fixed clearly in her mind was her soleintention: to turn up some shred of evidence that would convict Decker.She had to keep all other thoughts at bay: revulsion, grief, fear. She
[METAPHOR][TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][CHARACTERIZATION][SETTING]had to be cool and calm. Play Decker's game.Girding herself, she stepped through the archway.Not into the kitchen, however: into Midian.
[EMOTION][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][FLASHBACK][CONTEXT]She knew the moment it happened where she was the chill and the dark ofthe tombs was unmistakable. The kitchen had simply vanished: everytile.Across the chamber from her stood Rachel, looking up at the roof,distress on her face. For a moment she glanced at Lori, registering nosurprise at her presence. Then she returned to watching and
[SURPRISE][GHOST]listening.[DIALOGUE]"What's wrong?"Lori said.[DIALOGUE]"Hush/ Rachel said sharply, then seemed to regret her harshness andopened her arms. "Come to me, child," she said.Child. So that was it. She wasn't in Midian, she was in Babette,
[EMOTION][TRANSITION][FLASHBACK][PERSPECTIVE][SURPRISE]seeing with the child's eyes. The memories she'd felt so strongly onthe street had been a prelude to a union of minds.[DIALOGUE]"Is this real?"[DIALOGUE]"Real?"she said.Rachel whispered."Of course it's real..
[SURPRISE].[DIALOGUE]"Her words faltered, and she looked at her daughter with enquiry on herface."Babette?[DIALOGUE]"she said."No .. .[DIALOGUE]"Lori replied."Babette.
[FLASHBACK][PERSPECTIVE][METAPHOR][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][CONTEXT][EXPOSITION][CHARACTERIZATION][TRANSITION][CHARACTER][PROBLEM][HORROR]What have you done?"She moved towards the child, who backed away from her. Her viewthrough these stolen eyes brought a taste of the past back. Rachelseemed impossibly tall, her approach ungainly.
[EMOTION][CONFLICT][FLASHBACK][ACTION][SURPRISE][DIALOGUE]"What have you done?"she asked a second time.[DIALOGUE]"I've brought her," the girl said.To see."Rachel's face became furious. She snatched at her daughter's arm. But
the child was too quick for her. Before she could be caught she'dscooted away, out of Rachel's reach. Lori's mind's eye went with her,dizzied by the ride.[DIALOGUE]"Come back here," Rachel whispered.Babette ignored the instructions, and took to the tunnels, duckinground corner after corner with the ease of one who knew the labyrinthback to front. The route took runner and passenger off the main
[TRANSITION][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][CONFLICT][PROBLEM]thoroughfares and into darker, narrower passages, until Babette wascertain she was not being pursued. They had come to an opening in thewall, too small to allow adult passage. Babette clambered through, andinto a space no larger than a refrigerator, and as cold, which was thechild's hideaway. Here she sat to draw breath, her sensitive eyes ableto pierce the total darkness. Her few treasures were gathered around
her. A doll made of grasses, and crowned with spring flowers; two birdskulls, a small collection of stones. For all her other ness Babettewas in this like any child: sensitive, ritualistic. Here was herworld. That she'd let Lori see it was no small compliment.

[SURPRISE][CONFLICT][PROBLEM]I ain't going down.[DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE]""No need.""So how the fuck do we bring 'em up, asshole?[DIALOGUE]"The reply wasn't a word but a shot, ringing off stone."Be like shootin' fish in a barrel,[DIALOGUE]" somebody said.come up they can stay down there permanent."[DIALOGUE]"If they won't"Saves digging a grave!"Who are these people! Lori thought. No sooner had she asked the
[TRANSITION][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][EMOTION][CHARACTER]question than Babette was up and clambering into a narrow duct that ledoff her playroom. It was barely large enough to accommodate her smallbody; a twinge of claustrophobia touched Lori. But there wascompensation. Daylight up ahead, and the fragrance of the open air,which, warming Babette's skin, warmed Lori too.
[CONFLICT]The passage was apparently some kind of drainage system. The childsquirmed through an accumulation of debris, pausing only to turn overthe corpse of a shrew that had died in the duct. The voices from overground were distressingly close.[DIALOGUE]"I say we just start here and open up every damn tomb till we findsomething to take home."[DIALOGUE]"Nothing here I wanna take home."[DIALOGUE]"Shit, Pettine, I want prisoners1.get."As many of the fuckers as we can[DIALOGUE]"Shouldn't we call in first?" a fourth speaker now asked.dissenting voice had not so far been heardThisin the exchanges.

[DIALOGUE]"OK.Let's get the fuck on with it."[DIALOGUE]"Sooner the better," said Cas.[DIALOGUE]"Ready Tommy?"[DIALOGUE]"I'm always ready."The source of the light Babette was crawling towards now becameapparent: a latticed grille in the side of the tunnel.Keep out of the sun, Lori found herself thinking.It's all right, Babette's thoughts replied. Clearly this wasn't thefirst time she'd used the spy hole. Like a prisoner without hope of
[PERSPECTIVE]parole she took what entertainment she could find to ease the passageof time. Watching the world from here was one such distraction, andshe'd chosen her vantage point well. The grille offered a view of theavenues but was so placed in the mausoleum wall that direct sunlightdid not fall through it. Babette put her face close to the grille, toget a clearer grasp of the scene outside.
Lori could see three of the four speakers. All were in uniform; alldespite their brave talk looked like men who could think of a dozenbetter places to be than this. Even in broad daylight, armed to theteeth and safe in the sun, they were ill at ease. It wasn't difficultto guess why. Had they come to take prisoners from a tenement block
[DEATH][PROBLEM][DANGER][MURDER]there'd be none of the half glances and nervous tics on display here.But this was Death's territory, and they felt like trespassers.In any other circumstances she would have taken some delight in theirdiscomfiture. But not here, not now. She knew what men afraid, and
[EMOTION][CONFLICT][DANGER][PERSPECTIVE][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][CHARACTER][METAPHOR][HORROR]afraid of their fear were capable of.They'll find us, she heard Babette think.Let's hope not, her thoughts replied.But they will, the child said.
[METAPHOR][FLASHBACK][PERSPECTIVE][CHARACTER][CHARACTERIZATION][SURPRISE][MONSTER]The Prophetic says so.Who?Babette's answer was an image, of a creature Lori had glimpsed whenshe'd gone in pursuit of Boone in the tunnels: the beast with larvalwounds, lying on a mattress in an empty cell. Now she glimpsed it indifferent circumstances, lifted up above the heads of a congregation bytwo Breed, down whose sweating arms the creature's burning bloodcoursed. It was speaking, though she couldn't hear its words.
[DANGER][PERSPECTIVE][METAPHOR][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][CHARACTERIZATION][PLOT][WITCH]Prophecies, she presumed; and amongst them, this scene.They'll find us, and try to kill us all, the child thought.And will they'1.The child was silent.
[EMOTION][DEATH][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][DANGER][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][FLASHBACK]Will they, Babette?The Prophetic can't see, because it's one of those that'll die.I'll die too.MaybeThe thought had no voice, so came as pure feeling, a wave of sadnessthat Lori had no way to resist or heal.
[EMOTION][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][DANGER][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][PERSPECTIVE][HAUNTED HOUSE]One of the men, Lori now noticed, had sidled towards his colleague, andwas surreptitiously pointing at a tomb to their right. Its door stoodslightly ajar. There was movement within. Lori could see what wascoming; so could the child. She felt a shudder run down Babette's
[SURPRISE][DANGER][ACTION][EMOTION][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][PROBLEM][HORROR]spine, felt her fingers curl around the lattice, gripping it inanticipation of the horror ahead. Suddenly the two men were at thetomb door, and kicking it wide. There was a cry from within, somebodyfell. The lead cop was inside in seconds, followed by his partner, thedin alerting the third and fourth to the tomb door.
[EMOTION][CONFLICT][ACTION][TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][DANGER][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][RELIEF][DIALOGUE]"Out of the way!" the cop inside yelled. The trooper stepped back andwith a grin of satisfaction on his face the arresting officer draggedhis prisoner out of hiding, his colleague kicking from behind.Lori caught only a glimpse of their victim, but quick eyed Babettenamed him with a thought.Ohnaka.
[CONFLICT][TRANSITION][DIALOGUE]"On your knees, asshole," the cop bringing up the rear demanded, andkicked the legs from under the prisoner. The man went down, bowing hishead to keep the sun from breaching the defence of his wide brimmedhat.[DIALOGUE]"Good work, Gibbs," Pettine grinned.[DIALOGUE]"So where's the rest of them?"with a coxcomb, demanded.the youngest of the four, a skinny kid[DIALOGUE]"Underground, Tommy," the fourth man announced.said."

He looked up at Tommy'scompanion: a short, wide man. "You're good with the questions, Cas.[DIALOGUE]""Ain't nobody ever said no to me,[DIALOGUE]" the man replied.True or false?"
[CONFLICT]True,[DIALOGUE]"said Gibbs."You want this man on your case?[DIALOGUE]"said nothing."Don't think he heard,[DIALOGUE]" Gibbs said.Pettine asked Ohnaka.The prisoner"You ask him, Cas.[DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE]""Sure enough.""Ask him hard."Cas approached Ohnaka, reaching down and snatching the brimmed hat fromoff his head. Instantly, Ohnaka began to scream.
[DANGER][CONFLICT][EMOTION][DIALOGUE]"Shut the fuck up!" Cas yelled at him, kicking him in the belly.Ohnaka went on screaming, his arms crossed over his bald head to keepthe sun off it as he clambered to his feet. Desperate for the succourof the dark he started back towards the open door, but young Tommy wasalready there to block his way.[DIALOGUE]"Good man, Tommy!"Pettine hollered.[DIALOGUE]"Go get him Cas!"Forced back into the sun, Ohnaka had begun to shudder as though a fithad seized him.[DIALOGUE]"What the fuck?"said Gibbs.The prisoner's arms no longer had the strength to protect his head.
[WEAPON][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][ACTION][SURPRISE][PROBLEM]They fell to his sides, smoking, leaving Tommy to look straight intohis face. The boy cop didn't speak. He just took two stumbling stepsbackwards, dropping his rifle as he did so.[DIALOGUE]"What are you doin', dickhead?" Pettine yelled. Then he reached andtook hold of Ohnaka's arm to prevent him claiming the dropped weapon.
[CONFLICT]In the confusion of the moment it was difficult for Lori to see whathappened next, but it seemed Ohnaka's flesh gave way. There was a cryof disgust from Cas, and one of fury from Pettine as he pulled his handaway, dropping a fistful of fabric and dust.[DIALOGUE]"What the fackl' Tommy shouted."What the fuckl What the fuck![DIALOGUE]""Shut up![DIALOGUE]" Gibbs told him, but the boy had lost control.over, the same question:Over and"What the fuckVUnmoved by Tommy's panic, Cas went in to beat Ohnaka back down to hisknees. The blow he delivered did more than he intended. It broke
[CONFLICT][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][PROBLEM][ACTION][CLIMAX]Ohnaka's arm at the elbow, and the limb fell off at Tommy's feet. Hisshouts gave way to puking. Even Cas backed off, shaking his head indisbelief.Ohnaka was past the point of no return. His legs buckled beneath him,
[TRANSITION][EMOTION][PROBLEM][CONFLICT]his body growing frailer and frailer beneath the assault of the sun.But it was his face turned now towards Pettine that brought the loudestshouts, as the flesh dropped away and smoke rose from his eye socketsas though his brain were on fire.He no longer howled. There was no strength in his body left for that.
[CONFLICT][TRANSITION][DANGER][HORROR]He simply sank to the ground, head thrown back as if to invite thesun's speed, and have the agony over. Before he hit the paving somefinalstitch in his being snapped with a sound like a shot. His decayingremains flew apart in a burst of blood dust and bones.Lori willed Babette to look away, as much for her own sake as that ofthe child. But she refused to avert her eyes. Even when the horror
[DEATH][EMOTION][PROBLEM][DANGER][PERSPECTIVE][CONFLICT][MURDER]was over Ohnaka's body spread in pieces across the avenue she stillpressed her face to the grille, as if to know this death by sunlight inall its particulars. Nor could Lori look away while the child staredon. She shared every quiver in Babette's limbs; tasted the tears shewas holding back, so as not to let them cloud her vision. Ohnaka wasdead, but his executioners were not finished with their business yet.

Gibbs dug his trembling hand intohis trouser pocket for matches, his eyes fixed on the smokingremains.
[SURPRISE][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][DANGER][HORROR][DIALOGUE]"Never saw nothin' like that before," Pettine said, almost casually.[DIALOGUE]"You shit yourself this time, Tommy?"Gibbs said.[DIALOGUE]"Fuck you," came the reply.

[SURPRISE]I don't belong with you.She had no opportunity to qualify this hurried response. Contact wasbroken instantly the view from Babette's eyes disappearing and Lorifound herself standing on the threshold of the kitchen.The sound of flies was loud in her head. Their buzzing was no echo of
[DANGER][DEATH][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][ACTION][CONTEXT][PERSPECTIVE][MURDER]Midian, but the real thing. They were circling the room ahead of her.She knew all too well what scent had brought them here, egg laden andhungry, and she knew with equal certainty that after all she'd seen inMidian she couldn't bear to take another step towards the corpse on thefloor. There was too much death in her world, inside her head and out.
[DANGER][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][EMOTION]If she didn't escape it she'd go mad. She had to get back into theopen air, where she could breathe freely. Maybe find some unremarkableshop girl to talk to about the weather, about the price of sanitarytowels; anything as long as it was banal, predictable.But the flies wanted to buzz in her ears. She tried to swat them away.
[CONFLICT][EMOTION]Still they came at her and at her, their wings buttered with death,their feet red with it.[DIALOGUE]"Let me alone," she sobbed. But her excitement drew them in larger andstill larger numbers, rising at the sound of her voice from theirdining table out of sight behind the ovens. Her mind struggled to takehold of the reality she'd been thrown back into, her body to turn andleave the kitchen.Both failed, mind and body. The cloud of flies came at her, their
[SURPRISE][DANGER][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][EMOTION][HORROR]numbers now so large they were a darkness unto themselves. Dimly sherealized that such a multiplicity was impossible and that her mind wascreating this terror in its confusion. But the thought was too farfrom her to keep the madness at bay; her reason reached for it, andreached, but the cloud was upon her now. She felt their feet on herarms and face, leaving trails of whatever they'd been dabbling in:SheryFsblood, Sheryl's bile, Sheryl's sweat and tears. There; were so many
[CONFLICT][FLASHBACK][EMOTION][HORROR]of them they could not all find flesh to j occupy, so they began toforce their way between her lips, and crawl up her nostrils and acrossher eyes.Once, in a dream of Midian, hadn't the dead come as dust, from all fourcorners of the world? And hadn't she stood in the middle of the stormcaressed, eroded and been happy to know that the dead were on the wind?Now came the companion dream: horror to the splendour of the first. A
[EMOTION][PERSPECTIVE][CONFLICT][DANGER]world of flies to match that world of dust,- a world of incomprehensionand blindness, of the dead without burial, and without a wind to carrythem away. Only flies to feast on them, to lay in them and make moreflies.And matching dust against flies, she knew which she favoured, knew asconsciousness went out of her completely, that if Midian died and shelet it if Pettine and Gibbs and their friends dug up the Night breed'srefuge, then she, dust herself one day, and touched by Midian'scondition would have nowhere to be carried, and would belong, body andsoul, to the flies.Then she hit the tiles.
The Wrath of the RighteousFor Eigerman bright ideas and excretion were inextricably linked; hedid all his best thinking with his trousers around his ankles. Morethan once, in his cups, he'd explained to any who'd listen that worldpeace and a cure for cancer could be achieved overnight if the wise andthe good would just sit down and take a crap together.Sober, the thought of sharing that most private of functions would haveappalled him. The can was a place for solitary endeavour, where thoseweighed down by high office could snatch a little time to sit andmeditate upon their burdens.
[DEATH][RELIEF][PROBLEM]He studied the graffiti on the door in front of him. There was nothingnew amongst the obscenities, which was reassuring. Just the same olditches, needing to be scratched. It gave him courage in the face ofhis problems.Which were essentially twofold. First, he had a dead man in custody.
[METAPHOR][FLASHBACK][DANGER][PROBLEM][CHARACTER]That, like the graffiti, was an old story. But zombies belonged in thelate movie, like sodomy on a lavatory wall. They had no place in thereal world. Which brought him onto the second problem: the panickedcall from Tommy Caan, reporting that something bad was going down inMidian. To those two, on reflection, he now added a third: Doctor
[PROBLEM][DANGER][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][CHARACTER]Decker. He wore a fine suit, and he talked fine talk, but there wassomething unwholesome about him.Eigerman hadn't admitted the suspicion to himself | until now, sittingon the crapper, but it was plain as| his dick once he thought about it.The bastard knew| more than he was telling: not just about Dead Man!
[DANGER][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][EMOTION][CONTEXT][METAPHOR]Boone, but about Midian and whatever was going on I there. If he wassetting Shere Neck's finest up for a fall | then there'd come areckoning time, sure as shit, and he'd regret it.Meanwhile the Chief had to make some decisions. He'd begun the day asa hero, leading the arrest of the Calgary Killer, but instinct told himevents could very quickly get out of hand. There were so many
[SURPRISE][TRANSITION]imponderables in all of this; so many questions to which he had noanswers. There was an easy way out, of course. He could call up hissuperiors in Edmonton and pass the whole fuck-up along to them to dealwith. But if he gave away the problem he also gave the glory. The
[TRANSITION][CONFLICT][PERSPECTIVE][METAPHOR][DANGER][PROBLEM]alternative was to act now before nightfall, Tommy had kept saying, andhow far was that? three, four hours- to root out the abominations ofMidian. If he succeeded he'd double his helping of accolades. In one| day he'd not only have brought a human evil to justice but scouredthe cess-pit in which it had found succour: an appealing notion.
But again the answered questions raised their heads, and they weren'tpretty. If the doctors who'd examined Boone and reports coming out ofMidian were to be trusted then things he'd only heard in stories weretrue | today. Did he really want to pit his wits against dead men whowalked, and beasts that sunlight killed?He sat, and crapped, and weighed up the alternatives. It took him half
[SURPRISE][TRANSITION][FLASHBACK][PERSPECTIVE][MURDER]an hour, but he finally came to a decision. As usual, once the sweatwas over, it looked very simple. Perhaps today the world was not quitethe way it had been yesterday. Tomorrow, God willing, it would be itsold self: dead men dead, and sodomy on !| the walls where it belonged.
[ACTION][PERSPECTIVE][WEAPON][CHARACTER][TRANSITION][RESOLUTION][SURPRISE][CLIMAX][DANGER][SETTING][PROBLEM][CONTEXT][EXPOSITION][CONFLICT]If he didn't seize his chance to become a man of destiny there wouldn'tbeanother, at least not till he was too old to do more than tend hishaemorrhoids. This was a God given opportunity to show his mettle. Hecouldn't afford to ignore it. With new conviction in his gut he wipedhis ass, hauled up his pants, flushed the crapper and went out to meetthe challenge head-on.

We don't have much time.with you."Start with the bars.Take Holliday[DIALOGUE]"What are we telling them it's for?"Eigerman mused on this a moment: what to tell."Say we're looking for grave-robbers. That'll get a sizeable turnout.
[WEAPON][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][PERSPECTIVE][EXPOSITION][DANGER][HORROR]Anyone with a gun and a shovel's eligible. I want 'em mustered in anhour. Less if you can do it."Decker smiled as Cormack went on his way.

There was a
[EMOTION]number he'd been thinking about dialling since he'd made up his mind togo into Midian; a number he hadn't had reason to call in a long time.He dialled it now. In seconds, Father Ashbery was on the line.[DIALOGUE]"You sound breathless, Father."Ashbery knew who his caller was without need prompting.[DIALOGUE]"Eigerman."[DIALOGUE]"Got it in one.What have you been up to?"[DIALOGUE]"I've been out running."[DIALOGUE]"Good idea.Sweat out the dirty thoughts."[DIALOGUE]"What do you want?"[DIALOGUE]"What do you think I want?A priest."[DIALOGUE]"I've done nothing."[DIALOGUE]"That's not what I hear."[DIALOGUE]"I'm not paying, Eigerman.God forgave me my sins."[DIALOGUE]"Not in question."[DIALOGUE]"So leave me alone."[DIALOGUE]"Don't hangup!"Ashbery was quick to detect the sudden anxiety in Eigerman's voice.[DIALOGUE]"Well, well, "he said.
[DIALOGUE]"What?"[DIALOGUE]"You've got a problem."[DIALOGUE]"Maybe both of us do."[DIALOGUE]"Meaning?"[DIALOGUE]"I want you here real quick, with whatever you've got in the way ofcrucifixes and Holy Water."[DIALOGUE]"What for?"Trust me.[DIALOGUE]"Ashbery laughed."I'm not at your beck and call any longer, Eigerman.to tend.[DIALOGUE]"I've got a flock"So do it for them.[DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE][DIALOGUE]""What are you talking about?""You preach the Day of Judgement, right?it, over in Midian.[DIALOGUE]"Well they're warming up for"Who are?""I don't know who and I don't know why.All I know is, we need alittle holiness on our side, and you're the only priest I've got.""You're on your own, Eigerman.[DIALOGUE]""I don't think you're listening.I'm talking serious shit here.""I'm not playing any of your damn fool games.""I mean it, Ashbery.you.[DIALOGUE]"If you don't come of your own accord, I'll make"I burned the negatives, Eigerman.I'm a free man.""I kept copies.[DIALOGUE]"There was a silence from the Father.Then:"You swore.""I lied came the reply.

Hotweather always got folks itchy: for fornication maybe, or killing. AndShere Neck being what it was, and fornication not being so easy to getjust whenever you wanted it, the hunger to do some shooting was well uptoday. There were twenty men gathered outside in the sun, and three orfour women coming along for the ride; plus Ashbery and his HolyWater.
[CONFLICT][DANGER][PROBLEM]There'd been two more calls from Midian in that hour. One from Tommy,who was ordered back into the cemetery to help Pettine contain theenemy until reinforcements arrived, the second from Pettine himself,informing Eigerman that there'd been an escapebid made by one of Midian's occupants. He'd slipped away through themain gate while accomplices create a diversion. The nature of thisdiversion not onljji explained Pettine's choking as he delivered hisreport,! but also why they'd failed to give chase. Somebody had!

Killing was all very fine, but hewasn't so sure there'd ; be quite so many ready to roll now if it wascommon knowledge that some of the bastards were ready to' fight back.As the convoy moved off he looked at his watch. They had maybe two and
[CONFLICT][TRANSITION][DANGER][PERSPECTIVE][PROBLEM]a half hours of good light left before dusk began to settle in. Threequarters of an hour to Midian, which left an hour and three quarters toget these fuckers dealt with before the enemy had night on its side.That was long enough, if they were organized about it. Best to treatit like a regular shakedown, Eigerman supposed. Drive the bastards out
[DANGER][PERSPECTIVE][CLIMAX][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][TRANSITION][CONTEXT][EXPOSITION][RESOLUTION][WEAPON][ACTION][PROBLEM][CHARACTERIZATION][HELL]into the light and see what happened. If they came apart at the seams,the way piss pants Tommy had kept saying, then that was all the proof aJudge would need that these creatures were unholy as hell. If not ifDecker was lying, Pettine on dope again, and all this a fool's errandhe'd find someone to shoot, so it wasn't all a wasted journey. Mightjust turn around and put a bullet through the zombie in Cell Five; theman with no pulse and blood on his face.

[TRANSITION][RELIEF][CONFLICT][ACTION]Couldn't she just sink and ink, further into the nowhere she'd takenrefuge in? But it didn't want her. She rose from it, unwillingly, andinto the old pain of living and dying.The flies had gone. That at least was something. She got to her feet,
[SURPRISE][PROBLEM][EXPOSITION][DANGER][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][FLASHBACK][CHARACTERIZATION][HORROR]her body cumbersome; an embarrassment. As she made an attempt to dustthe dirt from her clothes she heard the voice calling her name. Shehadn't woken of her own accord, it seemed. Someone had called her. For
[TRANSITION][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][DANGER][PERSPECTIVE][METAPHOR][EMOTION][PROBLEM][HORROR]a ghastly moment, she thought the voice was Sheryl's; that the flieshad succeeded in their ambition, and driven her to lunacy. But when itcame a second time she put another name to it: Babette. The child wascalling her. Turning her back on the kitchen she picked up her bag andstarted through the debris towards the street. The light had changed
[CONFLICT][TRANSITION]since she'd made the first crossing; hours had passed while she'ddebated with sleep. Her watch, broken in the fall, refused to tell howmany.It was still balmy on the street, but the heat of noon had long passed.The afternoon was winding down. It could not be long until dusk.
[PERSPECTIVE]She began to walk, not once looking back at the restaurant. Whatevercrisis of reality had overcome her there, Babette's voice had calledher from it, and shefelt oddly buoyant, as though something about the way the world workedhad come clear.She knew what it was, without having to think too hard. Some vitalpart of her, heart or head or both, had made its peace with Midian andall it contained. Nothing in the chambers had been as agonizing as
[CONFLICT][PERSPECTIVE][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][CONTEXT][MONSTER]what she'd confronted in the burnt out building: the loneliness ofSheryl's body, the stench of creeping decay, the inevitability of itall. Against that the monsters of Midian -transforming, rearranging,ambassadors of tomorrow's flesh and reminders of yesterday's seemedfull of possibilities. Weren't there, amongst those creatures,faculties she envied? The power to fly; to be transformed; to know thecondition of beasts; to defy death?
[PROBLEM]All that she'd coveted or envied in others of her species now seemedvalueless. Dreams of the perfected anatomy the soap opera face, thecent refold body had distracted her with promises of true happiness.Empty promises. Flesh could not keep its glamour, nor eyes theirsheen. They would go to nothing soon.
[TRANSITION][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][DANGER][PROBLEM][CONTEXT][CHARACTERIZATION][HORROR]But the monsters were forever. Part of her forbidden self. Her dark,transforming midnight self. She longed to be numbered amongst them.
[PROBLEM][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][DANGER][MURDER]There was still much she had to come to terms with; not least theirappetite for human flesh, which she'd witnessed first-hand at theSweetgrass Inn. But she could learn to understand. In a real senseshe had no choice. She'd been touched by a knowledge that had changedher inner landscape out of all recognition. There was no way back to
[TRANSITION][METAPHOR][CONTEXT]the bland pastures of adolescence and early womanhood. She had to goforward. And tonight that meant along this empty street, to see whatthe coming night had in store.The idling engine of a car on the opposite side of the road drew herattention. She glanced across at it. Its windows were all wound up
[SURPRISE][PROBLEM][PERSPECTIVE][CONFLICT][DANGER]despite the warmth of the air- which struck her as odd. She could notseethe driver; both windows and windshield were too thick with grime. Butan uncomfortable suspicion was growing in her. Clearly the occupantwas waiting for someone. And given that there was nobody else on the
[SURPRISE][METAPHOR][ACTION][CONFLICT][DANGER][PROBLEM][TRANSITION]street, that someone was most likely her.If so, the driver could only be one man, for only one knew that she hada reason to be here: Decker.She started to run.The engine revved. She glanced behind her. The car was moving off
[SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][PROBLEM][TRANSITION]from its parking place, slowly. He had no reason to hurry. There wasno sign of life along the street. No doubt there was help to be had,if only she knew which direction to run. But the car had already
[ACTION][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][DANGER]halved the distance between them. Though she knew she couldn't outrunit, she ran anyway, the engine louder and louder behind her. She heardthe tyre walls squeal against the sidewalk. Then the car appeared ather side, keeping pace with her yard for yard.

As she did so, the man said, [DIALOGUE]"Don't scream."She didn't have the breath to make a sound, but she certainly had theinclination, when her eyes fell on the face in the gloom of the car.This was one of Midian's creatures, no doubt, but not a brother to thefabulous things she'd seen in the tunnels. The man's appearance was
[DANGER][PROBLEM][METAPHOR][CONFLICT][EXPOSITION][SURPRISE][CHARACTER][CHARACTERIZATION][HORROR]horrendous, his face raw and red, like uncooked liver.

If ever a man should have laid down and died, it wasthat man. Eigerman had never seen so many bullets in one lump of meat.But Boone hadn't laid down. At least not stayed down. He'd gone

The man liked to dressin women's dainties, which fact Eigerman had chanced upon and used asleverage when he'd needed sanctification of a sin or two of his own.But Decker's secrets remained a mystery.

And what would you say about Boone?"[DIALOGUE]"Is being a fucking zombie scientific too?"Eigerman pressed.[DIALOGUE]"I don't know," Decker murmured.[DIALOGUE]"Well, will you look at this? I've got a priest who doesn't believe inthe Devil, and a doctor who doesn't know science from his asshole. Thatmakes me feel real comfortable."Decker didn't respond.Ashbery did.[DIALOGUE]"You really think there's something up ahead, don't you?"[DIALOGUE]"You're sweating a flood."he said.[DIALOGUE]"Don't push, sweetheart," Eigerman said. [DIALOGUE]"Just dig out your littlebook of Exorcisms. I want those freaks sent back wherever the fuckthey came from. You're supposed to know how."There are other explanations these days, Eigerman,[DIALOGUE]" Ashbery replied."This isn't Salem. We're not going to a burning."
[SURPRISE][TRANSITION][EMOTION][PERSPECTIVE][VAMPIRE]Eigerman turned his attention back to Decker, floating his nextquestion lightly.[DIALOGUE]"What do you think, Doc? Think maybe we should try putting the zombieon the couch? Ask him if he ever wanted to fuck his sister?" Eigermanthrew a look at Ashbery. [DIALOGUE]"Or dress in her underwear?"[DIALOGUE]"I think we ate going to Salem/ Decker replied. There was anundercurrent in his voice Eigerman hadn't heard before. "And I also

[CONFLICT]That silenced the laugh."Asshole/ Eigerman said quietly.They drove the rest of the way in silence, Eigerman setting a new pacefor the convoy, Decker watching the light getting frailer with everymoment, and Ashbery, after a few minutes of introspection, leafingthrough his Book of Prayers, turning the onionskin pages at speed,looking for the Rites of Expulsion.Pettine was waiting for them fifty yards from the necropolis gate, hisface dirtied by smoke from the cars, which were still burning.

[DIALOGUE]"Two.The big one, and another on the northeast side."[DIALOGUE]"All right. So it shouldn't be difficult to contain them.

[DEATH][PROBLEM][FLASHBACK][METAPHOR][DANGER][CONTEXT][PERSPECTIVE][CONFLICT][WEAPON][MURDER]seemed to hear voices bringing thoughts of premature burial to mind.He'd seen that once; or its consequences.

[DANGER][EMOTION][PROBLEM]an observer of other men's labour. It made him feel impotent. It madehim long to show them his power. And that was always a dangerous urge.
[TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][DANGER][PLOT][CONFLICT][MURDER]The only eyes that could stare safely at his murder-hard were eyesabout to glaze" and even then he had to erase them when they'd looked,for fear they told what they'd seen.He turned his back on the cemetery and entertained himself with plansfor the future. With Boone's trial over, he'd be free to begin theMask's work afresh. He looked forward to that with a passion. He'd go

But no.[DIALOGUE]"You'd better keep your distance, then," he said, and turned away tohead back to the field of action.Decker drew the bag up towards his chest, and held it tight in hisarms.

[ACTION][SURPRISE][DIALOGUE]"Say it."[DIALOGUE]"Yes.Soon."That Desire we men had been left on duty at the station to guard theprisoner in Cell Five. Eigerman had -given them explicit instructions.They were not on any account to unlock the cell door, whatever noisesthey heard from within. Nor was any outside agency Judge, doctor orthe Good Lord Himself to be given access to the prisoner. And to
[DANGER][CONFLICT][ACTION][WEAPON][PERSPECTIVE][MURDER]enforce these edicts, should enforcement be necessary, troopers Cormack and Koestenbaum had been given the keys to the arsenal, and carteblanche to use extreme prejudice should the security of the station bein jeopardy. They weren't surprised. Shere Neck would most likelynever see another prisoner so certain to find his way into the annalsof atrocity as Boone. If he were to be sprung from custody Eigerman'sgood name would be cursed from coast to coast.
[DANGER][CONFLICT][HORROR]But there was more to the story than that, and both of them knew it.Though the Chief had not been explicit about the condition of theprisoner, rumours had been rife. The man was in some way freakish;possessed of powers that made him dangerous, even behind a locked andbolted door.Cormack was grateful, then, to have been left to guard the front of thestation, while Koestenbaum watched the cell itself. The whole place
[DANGER][WEAPON][PROBLEM][HORROR]was a fortress. Every window and door sealed. Now it was simply aquestion of sitting it out, rifle at the ready, until the'j cavalryreturned from Midian.It wouldn't be long. The kind of human garbage: they'd be likely to
[RELIEF][ACTION][PERSPECTIVE][TRANSITION][EMOTION][CONFLICT]find at Midian addicts, perverts, radicals would be rounded up in a fewhours, and the convoy on its way back to relieve the sentinels. Thentomorrow there'd be a force up from Calgary to take possession of theprisoner, and things would settle back into their regular pattern.Cormack wasn't in the policing business to sit and sweat the way he wasnow -he was in it for the easy feeling that came on a summer night whenhe could drive down to the corner of South and Emmett, and coerce oneof the professionals to put her face in his lap for half an hour. Thatwas what he liked the law for. Not this fortress under siege shit.

[DANGER][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][MURDER]Koestenbaum wasn't in sight to witness his de france of Eigerman'sorders, he whispered:[DIALOGUE]"Hold on."And unbolted the door top and bottom.He'd only opened it an inch and a hand darted through, its thumbslashing his face. The wound missed his eye by a centimetre, but thespurting blood turned half the world red. Semi-blind, he was thrownbackwards as the force on the other side of the door threw it open. He
[ACTION][WEAPON][CONFLICT][TRANSITION]didn't let the rifle go, however. He fired, first at the woman (theshot went wide), then at her companion, who ran at him half-crouchingto avoid the bullets. The second shot, though as wide as the first,brought blood. Not his target's, however. It was his own boot, and
[EMOTION][DANGER][SURPRISE][WEAPON][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][ACTION][HORROR]the good flesh and bone inside, that was spattered across the floor.[DIALOGUE]"Jesus Fucking Christ!"In his horror he let the rifle drop from his fingers. Knowing he'd notbe able to bend and snatch it up again without losing his balance heturned and started to hop towards the desk, where his gun lay.But Silver Thumbs was already there, swallowing the bullets likevitamin pills.Denied his de fences and knowing he could not stay vertical for morethan a few seconds, he began to howl.
[ACTION][DANGER][CONFLICT][RESOLUTION]Outside Cell Five, Koestenbaum held his post. He had his orders.Whatever happened beyond the door into the station itself he was tostand guard by the cell, defending it from any and every assault. Thathe was determined to do, however much Cormack yelled.
[TRANSITION][DANGER][PERSPECTIVE][DEATH][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][ACTION][MURDER]Grinding out his cigarette he drew the shutter in the cell door asideand put his eyes to the peep-hole. Thekiller had moved in the last few minutes, edging into the corner bydegrees, as if hunted by a patch of weak sunlight that fell through thetiny window high above him. Now he could go no further. He was wedgedin the corner, wrapped up in himself. Movement aside, he looked much
[METAPHOR][CHARACTERIZATION][SETTING][EXPOSITION][HELL]as he had all along: like wreckage. No danger to anyone.Appearances deceived, of course; Koestenbaum had been in uniform toolong to be naive about that. But he knew a defeated man when he sawone. Boone didn't even look up when Cormack let out another yelp. He
[DANGER][SURPRISE][ACTION][CONFLICT][EMOTION][WEAPON][PROBLEM][PERSPECTIVE]just watched the crawling sunlight from the corner of his eye, andshook.Koestenbaum slammed the peep-hole shut and turned back to watch thedoor through which Cor mack's attackers whoever they were had to come.They'd find him ready and waiting, guns blazing.He didn't have long to contemplate his last stand, as a blast blew outthe lock and half the door with it, shards and smoke filling the air.
[CONFLICT][ACTION]He fired into the confusion, seeing somebody coming at him. The manwas tossing away the rifle he'd used to blow the door, and was raisinghis hands, which glinted as they swept towards Koestenbaum's eyes. Thetrooper hesitated long enough to catch sight of his assailant's facelike something that should have been under bandages or six feet ofearth then he fired. The bullet struck its target, but slowed the mannot a jot, and before he could fire a second time he was up against thewall, with the raw face inches from his. Now he saw all too clearly
[CONFLICT]what glinted in the man's hands. A hook hovered an inch from the gleamof his left eye. There was another at his groin.[DIALOGUE]"Which do you want to live without?"the man said.[DIALOGUE]"No need," said a woman's voice, before Koestenbaum had a chance tochoose between sight and sex.[DIALOGUE]"Let me," Narcisse said.[DIALOGUE]"Don't let him," Koestenbaum murmured.
[CONFLICT][DANGER][EXPOSITION][PROBLEM][HORROR][DIALOGUE]"Please ... don't let him."The woman came into view now.

He glanced round to see her
[DANGER][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][EMOTION][FLASHBACK][ACTION]stepping into the cell. As he looked back the fist came at his face,and he dropped to the floor with his jaw broken in three places.Cormack had suffered the same summary blow, but he'd been alreadytoppling when it came, and instead of knocking him solidly intounconsciousness it had merely left him in a daze, from which he quicklyshook himself. He crawled to the door, and hauled himself, hand overhand, to his foot. Then he stumbled out in the street. The rush of
[SURPRISE][EMOTION][CONFLICT][DANGER][PERSPECTIVE][HORROR]homeward traffic was over, but there were still vehicles passing inboth directions, and the sight of a toe less trooper hobbling into themiddle of the street, arms raised, was enough to bring the flow oftraffic to a squealing halt.But even as the drivers and their passengers stepped out of the trucksand cars to come to his assistance Cormack felt the delayed shock ofhis self-wounding closing his system down. The words his helpers weremouthing to him reached his befuddled mind as nonsense.He thought (hoped) somebody had said:I'll get a gun."
[SURPRISE]But he couldn't be sure.He hoped (prayed) his lolling tongue had told them where to find thefelons, but he was even less sure of that.As the ring of faces faded around him, however, he realized his seepingfoot would have left a trail that would lead them back to thetransgressors. Comforted, he passed out.

"Youput yourself at risk for nothing."She hadn't expected this. Anger maybe, that she'd left him to be

But not this mumbling, broken creature,slumped in a corner like a boxer who'd fought a dozen too many fights.Where was the man she'd seen at the Inn, changing the order of his veryflesh in front of her? Where was the casual strength she'd seen; and

She wished she could dissolve it at will; have hishand stroking the skin between her breasts.[DIALOGUE]"They're going to come for us sooner or later," she said.Nor was she bluffing. There were voices from outside. A lynch-mob

[ACTION][EMOTION][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][EXPOSITION][METAPHOR]He didn't resist her. Instead the hand on her chest closed on theblouse, and he went down onto his knees in front of her, pressing hisface to her crotch, licking at it as if to tongue her clean of clothesand enter her with spit and spirit all in one.She was wet beneath the fabric. He smelt her heat for him.

Behind his sudden smile shemet the monster's eyes, dark, and darkening still as he delved forit.The look made her ache.[DIALOGUE]"Please ..."she murmured,[DIALOGUE]"... love me."He pulled at her blouse. It tore. His hand was through the gap in one
[DANGER][CONFLICT][PERSPECTIVE][TRANSITION][PROBLEM][CONTEXT][RESOLUTION][RELIEF][EXPOSITION][SURPRISE][MURDER]smooth motion, and beneath her bra for her breast. This was madness ofcourse. The mob would be upon them if they didn't get out quickly. Butthen madness had drawn her into this circle of dust and flies in thefirst place; why be surprised that her jjj; journey had brought herround to this new insanity? Better this than life without him. Better
[DEATH][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][CHARACTER][ACTION][PERSPECTIVE][METAPHOR][MONSTER]this than practically anything.He was getting to his feet, teasing her tit from hiding, putting hiscold mouth to her hot nipple, flicking it, licking it, tongue and teethin perfect play. Death had made a lover of him. Given him knowledgeof clay, and how to rouse it; made him easy with the body's mysteries.
[FLASHBACK][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][EMOTION]He was everywhere about her, working his hips against hers in slowgrinding circles trailing his tongue from her breasts to the sweat-bowlbetween her clavicles, and up along the ridge of her throat to herchin, thence to her mouth. KOnly once in her life had there been such wrenching j hunger in her.

[EMOTION]He'd told her no almost pityingly, as though someone so ignorant of therules was bound for grief. So she'd watched him dress and leave, angrywith herself for asking, and with him for such practised detachment.But she'd dreamt of him a dozen times in the weeks after, revisitingtheir squalid moments together, hungry for them again.She had them here. Boone was the lover of that dark corner, perfected.
[SURPRISE][EMOTION][CONFLICT][CHARACTER][TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE]Cool and feverish, urgent and studied. She knew his name this time;but he was still strange to her. And in the fervour of his possession,and in her heat for him, she felt that other lover, and all the loverswho'd come and gone before him, burned up. It was only their ash inher now where their tongues and cocks had been and she had power overthem completely.
[TRANSITION][EMOTION][ACTION][EXPOSITION]Boone was unzipping himself. She took his length in her hand. Now itwas his turn to sigh, as she ran her fingers along the underside of hiserection, up from his balls to where the ring of his circumcision scarbore a nugget of tender flesh. She stroked him there, tiny movementsto match the measure of his tongue back and forth between her lips.
[TRANSITION]Then, on the same sudden impulse, the teasing time was over. He waslifting her skirt, tearing at her underwear, his fingers going whereonly hers had been for too long. She pushed him back against the wall;pulled his jeans down to mid-thigh. Then, one arm hooked around hisshoulders, the other hand enjoying the silk of his cock before it wasout of sight, she took him inside. He resisted her speed, a delicious

He was in it to its length and breadth.
Even Narcisse was agog.[DIALOGUE]"Holy Shit," he muttered, then flung the door wide to let the night gorunning.The mob was itching for fun. Those with guns and rifles had broughtthem from their cars; those with the luck to have been travelling withrope in their trunks were practising knots; and those without rope orguns had picked up stones. For justification they needed to look nofurther than the spattered remains of Cor mack's foot, spread on thestation floor. The leaders of the group- who'd established themselves
[DANGER][CONFLICT][PERSPECTIVE][TRANSITION][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][CHARACTER][CONTEXT]immediately by natural selection (they had louder voices and morepowerful weapons) -were treading this red ground when a noise from thevicinity of the cells drew their attention.Somebody at the back of the crowd started shouting: "Shoot thebastards downl'It was not Boone's shadow the leaders' target-hungry^ eyes firstalighted upon.

Hehadn't fallen either, that they did see. And now one or two acted toput that to rights, firing a volley at Narcisse. Most of the shotswent wide, but not all.
[TRANSITION][SURPRISE][DANGER][CONFLICT]As the third bullet struck home, however, a roar of fury shook theroom, exploding the lamp on the desk and bringing dust from theceiling.Hearing it one or two of those just crossing the threshold changedtheir minds. Suddenly careless of what their neighbours might thinkthey began to dig their way out into the open air. It was still lighton the street; there was warmth to cancel the chill of fear that randown every human spine, hearing that cry. But for those at the head of
[CONFLICT][CHARACTER][WEAPON][PROBLEM][DANGER][CONTEXT][ACTION][MURDER]the mob there was no retreat. The door was jammed. All they could dowas stand their ground and aim their weapons, as the roarer emergedfrom the darkness at the back of the station.One of the men had been a witness at the Sweetgrass Inn that morning,and knew the man who now came into sight as the killer he'd seenarrested.

This little bullet,entering his chest and nicking his silent heart, was nothing. He
[TRANSITION][EMOTION][CONFLICT][RELIEF][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][CHARACTER]laughed it off and kept coming, feeling the change in him as hebreathed it out. His substance was fluid. It broke into droplets andbecame something new; part the beast he'd inherited from Peloquin, parta shade warrior, like Lylesburg; part Boone the lunatic, content withhis visions at last. And oh! the pleasure of it, feeling this

He saw their terror, andtook strength from it. They stole such authority for themselves, thesepeople. Made themselves arbiters of good and bad, natural and

Now they saw asimpler law at work, as their bowels remembered the oldest fear: ofbeing prey.They fled before him, panic spreading throughout their unruly ranks.The rifles and the stones were forgotten in the chaos, as howls forblood became howls for escape. Trampling each other in their haste,

Whichever, the weapon was dashed from his grip by Boone'sswelling hand, and the man flung himself into the throng of people toescape further confrontation.Daylight still ruled the street outside, and Boone was loath to stepinto it, but Narcisse was indifferent to such niceties.

[CONFLICT][SURPRISE][DANGER][PROBLEM]Of' Button Face was never more beautiful.Though Boone had advised Lori to stay with Narcisse, the sight ofMidian in flames was enough to draw her companion away from the safetyof the hill and down towards the cemetery gates. Lori went with him alittle way, but her presence seemed to intrude upon his grief, so shehung back a few paces, and in the smoke and deepening twilight was soondivided from him.The scene before her was one of utter confusion. Any attempt to
[DANGER][CONFLICT][EMOTION][SURPRISE][TRANSITION]complete the assault on the necropolis had ceased since Boone had sentEigerman running. Both his men and their civilian support hadretreated from around the walls. Some had already driven away, mostlikely fearing what would happen when the sun sankover the horizon. Most remained however, prepared to beat a retreatif necessary, but mesmerized by the spectacle of destruction. Her gaze
went from one to another, looking for some sign of what they werefeeling, but every face was blank. They looked like death masks, shethought, wiped of response. Except that she knew the dead now. Shewalked with them, talked with them. Saw them feel and weep. Who then
[SURPRISE][CONFLICT]were the real dead? The silent hearted, who still knew pain, or theirglassy-eyed tormentors?A break in the smoke uncovered the sun, teetering on the rim of theworld. The red light dazzled her. She closed her eyes against it.

[RELIEF][CONFLICT][RESOLUTION][TRANSITION][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE][WEAPON]came again.She glanced up at the Mask. He too had felt the tremors, and waslooking towards the cemetery. His distraction would be her onlyreprieve; she had to take it. Rolling out of his shadow she got to her

Fixing her eyes on the gatethrough which Boone had stepped, she stumbled down the hill, the dustysoil dancing at her feet.The source of the agitation was Midian. Its cue, the disappearance of
[PROBLEM][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][ACTION][DANGER][METAPHOR][SURPRISE][MONSTER]the sun, and with it the light that had trapped the Breed underground.It was their noise that made the ground shake, as they destroyed theirrefuge. What was below could remain below no longer.The Nightbreed were rising.
[HORROR]The knowledge didn't persuade her from her course. Whatever was looseinside the gate she'd long ago made her peace with it, and might expectmercy. From the horror at her back, matching her stride for stride,she could expect none.There were only the fires from the tombs up ahead to light her way now,a way strewn with the debris of the siege: petrol cans, shovels,discarded weapons. She was almost at the gates before she caught sight
[EMOTION][DANGER][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][TRANSITION][ACTION][PERSPECTIVE][HORROR]of Babette standing close to the wall, her face terror stricken."Rum' she yelled, afraid the Mask would wound the child.Babette did as she was told, her body seeming to melt into beast as sheturned and fled through the gates. Lori came a few paces after her,but by the time she was over the threshold the child had already gone,lost down the smoke filled avenues. The tremors here were strong
[SURPRISE][DANGER][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][EMOTION][WEAPON][PERSPECTIVE]enough to unseat the paving stones, and topple the mausoleums, asthough some force underground - Baphomet, perhaps, Who Made Midian wasshaking its foundations to bring the place to ruin. She hadn'tanticipated such violence; her chances of surviving the cataclysm wereslim.But better to be buried in the rubble than succumb to the Mask. And beflattered, at the end, that Fate had at least offered her a choice ofextinctions.
[FLASHBACK][EMOTION][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][HORROR]The HarrowingIn the cell back at Shere Neck memories of Midian's labyrinth hadtormented Boone. Closing his eyes against the sun he'd found himselflost here, only to open them again and find the maze echoed in thewhirls of his fingertips and the veins on his arms. Veins in which noheat ran; reminders, like Midian, of his shame.Lori had broken that spell of despair, coming to him not begging butdemanding he forgive himself.Now, back in the avenues from which his monstrous condition had sprung,he felt her love for him like the life his body no longer possessed.
[DANGER][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][ACTION][METAPHOR][HORROR]He needed its comfort, in the pandemonium. The Nightbreed were notsimply bringing Midian down, they were erasing all clue to their natureor keepsake of their passing. He saw them at work on every side,labouring to finish what Eigerman's scourge had begun. Gathering upthe pieces of their dead and throwing them into the flames; burningtheir beds, their clothes, anything they couldn't take with them.
[SURPRISE][TRANSITION]These were not the only preparations for escape. He glimpsed the Breedin forms he'd never before had the honour to see: unfurling wings,unfolding limbs. One becoming many (a man, a flock); many becoming one(three lovers, a cloud). All around, the rites of departure.
[GHOST]Ashbery was still at Boone's side, agog.[DIALOGUE]"Where are they going?"[DIALOGUE]"I'm too late Boone said."They're leaving Midian.[DIALOGUE]"The lid of a tomb ahead flew off, and a ghost form rose like a rocketinto the night sky."Beautiful,[DIALOGUE]" Ashbery said.them?""What are they?Why have I never knownBoone shook his head. He had no way to describe the Breed that werenot the old ways. They didn't belong to Hell; nor yet to Heaven. They
[PROBLEM][DANGER][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][ALIEN]were what the species he'd once belonged to could not bear to be. Theunpeople; the anti-tribe; humanity's sack unpicked and sewn togetheragain with the moon inside.And now, before he'd a chance to know them and by knowing them, knowhimself-he was losing them. They were finding transport in theircells, and rising to the night.
[TRANSITION][EMOTION][CONFLICT]Too late," he said again, the pain of this parting bringing tears tohis eyes.The escapes were gathering momentum. On every side doors were beingthrown wide, and slabs overturned, as the spirits ascended ininnumerable forms. Not all flew. Some went as goat or tiger, racingthrough the flames to the gate. Most went alone, but some whose
[CONFLICT][DEATH][DANGER][PROBLEM][PERSPECTIVE][TRANSITION][ACTION][CONTEXT][MURDER]fecundity neither death nor Midian had slowed went with families of sixor more, their littlest in their arms. He was witnessing, he knew, thepassing of an age, the end of which had begun the moment he'd firststepped on Midian's soil. He was the maker of this devastation, thoughhe'd set no fire and toppled no tomb. He had brought men to Midian. Indoing so, he'd destroyed it. Even Lori could not persuade him to
[SURPRISE][PROBLEM][CONTEXT][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][CHARACTERIZATION][MONSTER]forgive himself that. The thought might have tempted him to theflames, had he not heard the child calling his name.She was only human enough to use words; the rest was beast.[DIALOGUE]"Lori," she said.[DIALOGUE]"What about her?"[DIALOGUE]"The Mask has her."The Mask?She could only mean Decker.
[DANGER][CONFLICT][DIALOGUE]"Where?"Close, and closer still.Knowing she couldn't outpace him she tried instead to out dare him,going where she hoped he would not. But he was too hot for her life tobe shaken off. He followed her into territory where the ground eruptedbeneath their feet, and smoking stone rained around them.
[EMOTION][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][PERSPECTIVE][METAPHOR]It was not his voice that called her, however.[DIALOGUE]"Lori! This way!" She chanced a desperate look, and there God lovehim! was Narcisse, beckoning. She veered off the pathway, or what wasleft of it, towards him, ducking between two mausoleums as theirstained glass blew, and a stream of shadow, pricked with eyes, left itshiding place for the stars. It was like a piece of night sky itself,she marvelled. It belonged in the heavens.
[DANGER][CONFLICT][WEAPON][PROBLEM][TRANSITION][MONSTER]The sight slowed her pace by an all but fatal step. The Mask closedthe gap between them and snatched at her blouse. She threw herselfforward to avoid the stab she knew must follow, the fabric tearing asshe fell. This time he had her. Even as she reached for the wall to
haul herself to her feet she felt his gloved hand at her nape."Fuckheactt' somebody shouted.She looked up to see Narcisse at the other end of the passage betweenthe mausoleums. He'd clearly caught Decker's attention. The hold onher neck was relaxing. It wasn't enough for her to squirm free, but if

[CONFLICT][ACTION][TRANSITION][DANGER][PROBLEM][WEAPON][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK][CONTEXT]delivered a swift downward stroke that separated Narcisse's left handfrom his wrist in a single cut. Shaking his head, Narcisse took abackward step, but the Mask matched his retreat, raising the machete asecond time and bringing it down on his victim's skull. The blowdivided Narcisse's head from scalp to neck. It was a wound even a deadman could not survive. Narcisse's body began to shake, and then like
[DANGER][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][SURPRISE][EMOTION]Ohnaka, trapped in sunlight he came apart with a crack, a chorus ofhowls and sighs emerging, then taking flight.Lori let out a sob, but stifled anything more. There was no time tomourn. If she waited to shed a single tear the Mask would claim her,and Narcisse's sacrifice would have been for nothing. She started to
[CONFLICT][PROBLEM][ACTION][TRANSITION][SURPRISE]back away, the walls shaking to either side of her, knowing she shouldsimply run but unable to detach herself from the sight of the Mask'sdepravity. Rooting amid the carnage he skewered half of Narcisse'shead on the finer of his blades, then rested the knife on his shoulder,trophy and all, before renewing his pursuit.Now she ran, out of the shadow of the mausoleumsand back onto the main avenue. Even if memory could have offered aguide to her whereabouts all the monuments had gone to the same rubble,she could not tell north from south. It was all one in the end.

[TRANSITION][CONFLICT][ACTION][DANGER][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][MURDER]But even as she resigned herself to his knife the stretch of pavingbetween her and her slaughterer cracked open, a plume of smokeshielding her from the Mask. An instant later the whole avenue openedup. She fell. Not to the ground. There was no ground. But into the

Hadn't it spoken prophecies to him? whispered in his head and

He'd come to appeal toBaphomet as one of the newly dead, requesting a place in the earth. Buthe'd been greeted like an actor in some future drama. Called by
[CONFLICT][PROBLEM][DANGER][SURPRISE]another name, even. He'd wanted none of it. Not the auguries; not thename. He'd fought them, turning his back on the Baptiser; stumblingaway, shaking the whispers from his head.
[CONFLICT][FLASHBACK][PROBLEM][TRANSITION][METAPHOR][WEAPON][CHARACTERIZATION]In that he'd not succeeded. At the thought of Baphomet's presence itswords, and that name, were back like Furies.You're Cabal, it had said.He'd denied it then; he denied it now.

The avenue in front of them had beensplit open; light and smoke poured up through the ruptured ground.
[EMOTION]There was no sign of anything living.[DIALOGUE]"I don't see her," he said.[DIALOGUE]"She's underground," the child replied.[DIALOGUE]"In the pit."[DIALOGUE]"Direct me then."[DIALOGUE]"I can't go any further."[DIALOGUE]"Why not?"[DIALOGUE]"Put me down. I've taken you as far as I can." A barely suppressedpanic had crept into her voice. Tut me down,[DIALOGUE]" she insisted.Boone dropped to his haunches, and the child slid off his shoulders."What's wrong?[DIALOGUE]"he said."I mustn't go with you.It's not allowed."After the havoc they'd come through, her distress was bewildering.
[DANGER][DIALOGUE]"What are you afraid of ?"he said.[DIALOGUE]"I can't look," she replied.[DIALOGUE]"Not at the Baptiser."[DIALOGUE]"It's here?"She nodded, retreating from him as new violence opened the fissureahead even wider.[DIALOGUE]"Go to Lori," she told him.[DIALOGUE]"Bring her out.You're all she has."Then she was gone, two legs becoming four as she fled, leaving Boone tothe pit.Lori's consciousness flickered out as she fell. When she came round,seconds later, she was lying half way up, or down, a steep slope. Theroof above her was still intact, but badly fractured, the cracksopening even as she watched, presaging total collapse. If she didn't
[DANGER][ACTION][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][EMOTION]move quickly she'd be buried alive. She looked towards the head of theslope. The cross tunnel was open to the sky. She began to crawltowards it, earth cascading down on her head, the walls creaking asthey were pressed to surrender.
[SUSPENSE][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][PROBLEM][EMOTION][FLASHBACK][DIALOGUE]"Not yet..."she murmured.[DIALOGUE]"Please, not yet..."It was only as she came within six feet of the summit that her dazedsenses recognized the slope. She'd carried Boone up this very inclineonce, away from the power that resided in the chamber at the bottom.Was it still there, watching her scrabblings? Or was this wholecataclysm evidence of its departure: the architect's farewell? She
[TRANSITION][EMOTION][DANGER][ACTION]couldn't feel its surveillance, but then she could feel very little.Her body and mind functioned because instinct told them to. There waslife at the top of the slope. Inch by wracking inch she was crawlingto meet it.
Another minute and she reached the tunnel, or its roofless remains. Shelay on her back for a time, staring up at the sky. With her breathregained she got to her feet and examined her wounded arm. The cutswere gummed up with dirt, but at least the blood had ceased to flow.
[EMOTION]As she coaxed her legs to move something fell in front of her, wet inthe dirt. Narcisse looked up at her with half a face. She sobbed hisname, turning her eyes to meet the Mask. He straddled the tunnel likea gravedigger then dropped down to join her.
[DANGER][WEAPON][CONFLICT][ACTION][PROBLEM][TRANSITION][SURPRISE]The spike was aimed at her heart. Had she been stronger it would havestruck home, but the earth at the head of the slope gave way beneathher backward step and she had no power to keep herself from falling,head over heels, back down the incline Her cry gave Boone direction. Heclambered over upended slabs of paving into the exposed tunnels, thenthrough the maze of toppled walls and dying fires towards her. It wasnot her figure he saw in the passage ahead, however, turning to meethim with knives at the ready.
[WEAPON][CONFLICT][ACTION][PERSPECTIVE][TRANSITION]It was the doctor, at last.From the precarious safety of the slope Lori saw the Mask turn fromher, diverted from its purpose. She had managed to arrest her fall bycatching hold of a crack in the wall with her good hand, which did itsduty long enough for her to glimpse Boone in the passageway above.She'd seen what the machete had done to Narcisse. Even the dead had
[DANGER][CONFLICT][MURDER]their mortality. But before she could utter any word of warning toBoone a wave of cold power mounted the slope behind her. Baphomet hadnot vacated its flame. It was there still, its grasp un picking herfingers from the wall.
[DANGER]Unable to resist it, she slid backwards down the slope, into theerupting chamber.The ecstasies of the Breed hadn't tainted Decker. He came at Boonelike an abattoir worker to finish a slaughter he'd been called from:without flourish, without passion.It made him dangerous. He struck quickly, with no signal of his
[CONFLICT][TRANSITION][DANGER][WEAPON][PERSPECTIVE]intention. The thin blade ran straight through Boone's neck.To disarm the enemy Boone simply stepped away from him. The knife slidthrough Decker's fingers, still caught in Boone's flesh. The doctor
[EMOTION][ACTION][CONFLICT]made no attempt to claim it back. Instead he took a two-handed griponthe skull splitter. Now there was some sound from him: a low moanthat broke into gasps as he threw himself forward to despatch hisvictim.Boone ducked the slicing blow, and the blade embedded itself in thetunnel wall. Earth spattered them both as iDecker pulled it free. Then
[PROBLEM]he swung again, this time missing his target's face by a fingerlength.Caught off balance, Boone almost fell, and his downcast eyes chanced onDecker's trophy. He couldn't mistake that maimed face. Narcisse/ cutup and dead in the dirt.

[SURPRISE][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][DANGER][WEAPON][EXPOSITION][MONSTER]some absurd idea that this final confrontation should be man to man;that they'd trade words as they fought, and he'd undo the doctor's egobefore he undid his life.It wouldn't be that way. This wasn't a patient's revenge on hiscorrupted healer: this was a beast and a butcher, tooth to knife.He exhaled, and the truth in his cells came forth like honey. His
[CLIMAX][SURPRISE][EMOTION][ACTION][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][FLASHBACK][WEAPON][RELIEF][MONSTER]nerves ran with bliss; his body throbbed as it swelled. In life he'dnever felt so alive as he did at these moments, stripping off hishumanity and dressing for the night.[DIALOGUE]"No more ..."he said, and let the beast come from him everywhere.Decker raised his machete to undo the enemy before the change had beencompleted. But Boone didn't wait. Still transforming, he tore at the
[EMOTION][DANGER][SURPRISE][CONFLICT]butcher's face, taking off the mask buttons, zipper and all to uncoverthe infirmities beneath.Decker howled at being revealed, putting his hand up to his face tohalf cover it against the beast's stare.Boone snatched the mask up from the ground, and began to tear it apart,his claws shredding the linen. Decker's howls mounted. Dropping his
[ACTION][CONFLICT]hand from his face he began to swipe at Boone with insane abandon. Theblade caught Boone's chest, slicing it open, but as it returned for asecond cut Boone dropped the rags and blocked the blow, carryingDecker's arm against the wall with such force he broke the bones. Themachete fell to the ground, and Boone reached out for Decker's face.The steep howl stopped as the claws came at him. The mouth closed.
[WEAPON][CONFLICT]The features slackened. For an instant Boone was looking at a facehe'd studied for hours, hanging on its every word. At that thought hishand went from face to neck and he seized Decker's windpipe, which hadfunded so many lies. He closed his fist, his claws piercing the meatof Decker's throat. Then he pulled. The machinery came out in a wash

[CONFLICT][TRANSITION][FLASHBACK][ACTION][EMOTION][SURPRISE][MURDER]started to sag.Boone didn't let it drop. He held it as in a dance, and undid theflesh and bone as he'd undone the mask, clots of Decker's body strikingthe walls. There was only the dimmest memory of Decker's crimesagainst him in his head now. He tore with a Breed's zeal, taking
[CLIMAX][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][DANGER][METAPHOR][EMOTION][HORROR]monstrous satisfaction in a monstrous act. When he'd done his worst hedropped the wreckage to the earth, and finished the dance with hispartner underfoot.There'd be no rising from the grave for this body.Nohope of earthly resurrection. Even in the full flood of his attack
Boone had withheld the bite that would have passed life after deathinto Decker's system. His flesh belonged only to the flies, and theirchildren; his reputation to the vagaries of those who chose to tell hisstory. Boone didn't care. If he never shrugged off the crimes Deckerhad hung around his neck it scarcely mattered now. He was no longer

There was only one placeshe could have gone: down the slope into Baphomet's chamber. There waspattern in this, he saw. The Baptiser had brought her here, unknitting the ground beneath her feet so as to bring Boone after.
[CONFLICT][DANGER][SURPRISE]The flame its divided body occupied threw a cold glamour up into hisface. He started down the slope towards it, dressed in the blood ofhis enemy.CabalDit in the wasteland, Ashbery was found by a light, lickering up frombetween the fractured paving stones. Its beams were bitterly cold, andsticky in a way light had no right to be, adhering to his sleeve andhand before fading away. Intrigued, he tracked its source from one

He would haveknown the deity as god and goddess in one body. Would have known toohow its worshippers had suffered for their idol, burned as heretics, orfor crimes against nature.

But Baphomet's words were no empty promise. Theblood he wore grew hot as the air around him grew colder. He took

They'draised their arms, over which shrouds were draped, and the flame wallbroke as pieces of Baphomet's body were dropped into the travellers'waiting arms, to be wrapped up instantly and put from sight.This parting of piece from piece was agonizing. Cabal felt the pain as
[SURPRISE][PROBLEM][DANGER][CONFLICT][MONSTER]his own, filling him up until it was almost beyond enduring. To escapeit he began to retreat from the flame.But as he did so the one piece yet to be claimed tumbled into view infront of his face. Baphomet's head. It turned to him, vast and white,

He stumbled out of the fire as Lylesburgthe last of the adherents in the chamber- received the head from theflames and wrapped it up.Its tenants departed, the flame's ferocity redoubled.

Thefire caught him, sweeping him up as it hurtled heavenward. He shriekedat its touch, and at the aftertaste of Baphomet that flooded hissystem. His many masks were burned away. The robes first, then the
[TRANSITION][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK][PROBLEM][CLIMAX][CONFLICT]lace he'd not been able to pass a day of his adult life withoutwearing. Next the sexual anatomy he'd never much enjoyed. Andfinally, his flesh, scrubbing him clean. He fell back to earth morenaked than he'd been in his mother's womb, and blind. The impact
[SURPRISE][DANGER][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][EXPOSITION][ACTION]smashed his legs and arms beyond repair.Below, Cabal shook himself from the daze of revelation. The fire hadblown a hole in the roof of the chamber, and was spreading from it inall directions. It would consume flesh as easily as earth or stone.
[EMOTION][SURPRISE][DANGER][CONFLICT][METAPHOR]They had to be out of here before it found them. Lori was awake. Fromthe suspicion in her eyes as he approached it was plain she'd seen theBaptism, and feared him.[DIALOGUE]"It's me," he told her.He offered her a hand.
[WEAPON][CONFLICT][DIALOGUE]"It's still me."She took it, and he pulled her to her feet.[DIALOGUE]"I'll carry you," he said.She shook her head. Her eyes had gone from him to something on thefloor behind him. He followed her gaze. Decker's blade lay close to

The tunnel,collapsing on itself, had already buried him, as it was burying all ofMidian. A tomb for the tombs.
[DANGER]With so much already levelled it wasn't difficult to find their way outto the main gates. They saw no sign of Midian's inhabitants on theirway. Either the fire had consumed their remains, or rubble and earthcovered them.Just outside the gate, left where they could not fail to find it, was areminder for Lori of one whom she prayed had escaped unharmed.
[SURPRISE][FLASHBACK][METAPHOR][TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][EMOTION]Babette's doll woven from grasses, and crowned with spring flowers layin a small ring of stones. As Lori's fingers made contact with the toyit seemed she saw one final time through the child's eyes a landscapemoving by as somebody speeded her away to safety. The glimpse was alltoo brief. She had no time to pass a prayer for good fortune along tothe child before the vision was startled from her by a noise at herback. She turned to see that the pillars which had supported Midian's

Cabal snatched her arm as the twostone slabs struck each other, teetered head to head like matchedwrestlers, then fell sideways to hit the ground where moments beforeLori and Cabal had stood.Though he had no watch to read the hour, Cabal had a clear senseBaphomet's gift, perhaps of how long they had until daybreak. In hismind's eye he could see the planet, like a clock face decorated withseas, the magical divide of night from day creeping around it.

The priest still had life inhim, a fact given the severity of his injuries that verged on themiraculous. Both his legs were amputated in the days following, and
[SURPRISE][TRANSITION][ACTION][PERSPECTIVE][CONFLICT][RESOLUTION][CONTEXT][SETTING][WEAPON][EXPOSITION][PROBLEM]one of his arms up to mid-bicep. He didn't emerge from his coma afterthe operations, nor did he die, though every surgeon opined that hischances were virtually zero. But the same fire that had maimed him hadlent him an unnatural fortitude. Against all the odds, he endured.
[CONFLICT][DANGER]He was not alone through the nights and days of unconsciousness.Eigerman was at his side twenty hours out of every twenty-four, waitinglike a dog at a table for some scrap from above, certain that thepriest could lead him to the evil that had undone both their lives.He got more than he bargained for. When Ashbery finally rose from thedeep, after two months of teetering on extinction, he rose voluble.
[SURPRISE][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][TRANSITION][PROBLEM][DANGER][CHARACTER]Insane, but voluble. He named Baphomet. He named Cabal. He told, inthe hieroglyphs of the hopelessly lunatic, of how the Breed had takenthe pieces of their divinity's body and hidden them. More than that.
[EMOTION][FLASHBACK]He said he could find them again. Touched by the Baptiser's fire, andits survivors, he wanted the touch again.[DIALOGUE]"I can smell God," he'd say, over and over.[DIALOGUE]"Can you take us to Him?"Eigerman asked.The answer was always yes.
[DIALOGUE]"I'll be your eyes then Eigerman volunteered."We'll go together."Nobody else wanted the evidence Ashbery offered, there were too manynon senses to be accounted for as it was, without adding to the burdenon reality. The authorities gladly let Eigerman have custody of thepriest. They deserved each other, was the common opinion. Not one
sane cell between them.Ashbery was utterly dependent on Eigerman: incapable, at least at thebeginning, of feeding, shitting or washing without help. Repugnant asit was to tend the imbecile, Eigerman knew Ashbery was a God-givengift. Through him he might yet revenge himself for the humiliations ofMidian's last hours. Coded in Ashbery's rantings were clues to the
[DANGER][METAPHOR][FLASHBACK][APOCALYPSE]enemy's whereabouts. With time he'd decipher them.And when he did oh when he did there would come such a day of reckoningthe Last Trump would pale beside.The visitors came by night, stealthily, and took refuge wherever theycould find it.

Hard laws to live by, but not as hardas the consequences of breaking them.The rest was patience, and they were well used to that. Theirliberator would come eventually, if they could only survive the wait.
[SURPRISE][CHARACTER][TRANSITION][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][EMOTION][MONSTER]Few had any clue as to the shape he'd come in. But all knew his name.Cabal, he was called. Who Unmade Midian. Their prayers were full of
[DANGER][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][EMOTION][PROBLEM][FLASHBACK][CONFLICT]him. On the next wind, let him come. If not now, then tomorrow.They might not have prayed so passionately had they known what asea-change his coming would bring. They might not have prayed at all
[SURPRISE][DANGER][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][FLASHBACK]had they known I they prayed to themselves. But these were revelationsfor a later day. For now, they had simpler concerns. Keeping thechildren from the roofs at night; the bereaved from crying out tooloud; the young in summer from falling in love with the human. It was
[TRANSITION]a life.Clive Barker's previous novel was WEAVE WORLD The following pages aretaken from the early part of that novel.THE SUIT OF LIGHTSThe day Cal stepped out into was humid and stale. It could not be longbefore the summer let fall take its toll. Even the breeze seemed
[CONFLICT][PROBLEM][DANGER][SURPRISE]weary, and its condition was contagious. By the time Cal reached thevicinity of Rue Street his feet felt swollen in his shoes and his brainin his skull.And then, to add insult to injury, he couldn't find the damn street.He'd made his way to the house the previous day with his eyes on thebirds rather than on the route he was following, so he had only animpressionistic notion of its whereabouts. Knowing he could well
[SURPRISE][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][EMOTION][DANGER]wander for several hours and not find the street, he asked the way froma gaggle of six-year-olds, engaged in war games on a street corner. Hewas confidently re-directed. Either through ignorance or malice,however, the directions proved hopelessly incorrect, and he foundhimself in ever more desperate circles, his frustration mounting.Any sixth sense he might have hoped for some instinct that would leadhim unerringly to the region of his dreams- was conspicuous by itsabsence.
[CONFLICT][SURPRISE][PROBLEM]It was luck then, pure luck, that brought him finally to the corner ofRue Street, and to the house that had once belonged to MimiLaschenski.Suzanna had spent much of the morning attempting to do as she hadpromised Doctor Chai: notifying UncleCharlie in Toronto. It was a frustrating business. For one thing,the small hotel she'd found the previous night only boasted a singlepublic telephone, and other guests wanted access to it as well as she.
For another, she had to call round several friends of the family untilshe located one who had Charlie's telephone number, all of which tookthe best part of the morning. When, around one, she finally madecontact, Mimi's only son took the news without a trace of surprise.There was no offer to drop his work and rush to his mother's bedside,only a polite request that Suzanna call back when there was 'morenews'. Meaning, presumably, that he didn't expect her to ring againuntil it was time for him to send a wreath. So much for filial
[PROBLEM][METAPHOR][PERSPECTIVE][SURPRISE][EMOTION][CONFLICT][CHARACTERIZATION]devotion.The call done, she rang the hospital. There was no change in thepatient's condition. She's hanging on, was the duty nurse's phrase. It
[SURPRISE][METAPHOR]conjured an odd image of Mimi as mountaineer, clinging to a cliff-face.She took the opportunity to ask about her grandmother's personaleffects, and was told that she'd come into hospital without so much asa nightgown. Most probably the vultures Mrs. Fumphrey had spoken ofwould by now have taken anything of worth from the house the tall-boyincluded but she elected to call by anyway, in case she could salvageanything to make Mimi's dwindling hours a little more comfortable.She found a small Italian restaurant in the vicinity of the hotel tolunch in, then drove to Rue Street.
The back yard gate had been pushed closed by the removal men, but leftunbolted. Cal opened it, and stepped into the yard.If he had expected some revelation, he was disappointed.nothing remarkable here. Just
There wasparched chickweed sprouting between the paving stones, and a litter ofchattels the trio had discarded as worthless. Even the shadows, whichmight have hidden some glory, were wan and un secretiveStanding in the middle of the yard where all of the mysteries that hadoverturned his sanity had been unveiled he doubted for the first time,truly doubted, that anything had in fact happened the previous day.Maybe there would be something inside the house, he told himself; someflotsam he could cling to that would bear him up in this flood ofdoubt.He crossed the ground where the carpet had lain, to the back door. The
[CONFLICT][SURPRISE][HORROR]removal men had left it unlocked; or else vandals had broken in. Eitherway, it stood ajar. He stepped inside.At least the shadows were heavier within, there was some room for thefabulous. He waited for his eyes to accommodate the murk. Was it
[HAUNTED HOUSE]really only twenty four hours since he'd been here, he thought, as hissharpening gaze scanned the grim interior; only yesterday that he'dentered this house with no more on his mind than catching a lost bird?This time he had so much more to find.He wandered through to the hallway, looking everywhere for some echo ofwhat he'd experienced the day before. With every step he took hishopes fell further. Shadows there were, but they were deserted. The
[PROBLEM][DANGER]place was shorn of miracles. They'd gone when the carpet wasremoved.Half way up the stairs he halted. What was the use of going anyfurther? It was apparent he'd missed his chance. If he was to
[CHARACTER][CHARACTERIZATION][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][CONFLICT][METAPHOR][DANGER][FLASHBACK][CONTEXT][EMOTION][TRANSITION][PROBLEM][ACTION][HORROR]rediscover the vision he'd glimpsed and lost he'd have to searchelsewhere. It was mere doggedness, therefore- one of Eileen'sattributes- that made him continue to climb.At the top of the stairs the air was so leaden it made drawing breath achore. That, and the fact that he felt like a trespasser todayunwelcome in this tomb 259made him anxious to confirm his belief that the place had no magic toshow him, then get gone.
[SURPRISE][TRANSITION][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][ACTION]As he went to the door of the front bedroom something moved behind him.He turned. The labourers had piled several articles of furniture atthe top of the stairs, then apparently decided they weren't worth thesweat of moving any further. A chest of drawers, several chairs andtables. The sound had come from behind this furniture. And now it
[METAPHOR][PERSPECTIVE][FLASHBACK][CONFLICT][SURPRISE][CHARACTERIZATION][TRANSITION]came again.Hearing it, he imagined rats. The sound suggested several sets ofscurrying paws. Live and let live, he thought: he had no more right tobe here than they did. Less, perhaps. They'd probably occupied the
[PROBLEM][HAUNTED HOUSE]house for rat generations.He returned to the job at hand, pushed open the door, and stepped intothe front room. The windows were grimy, and the stained lace curtainsfurther clogged the light. There was a chair overturned on the bareboards, and three odd shoes had been placed on the mantelpiece by somewit. Otherwise empty.
He stood for a few moments and then, hearing laughter in the street andneeding its reassurance, crossed to the window and drew the curtainaside. But before he found the laughter's source he forsook thesearch. His belly knew before his senses could confirm it thatsomebody had entered the room behind him. He let the curtain drop andlooked around. A wide man in late middle-age, dressed too well for
[EMOTION][TRANSITION]this dereliction, had joined him in the half-light. The threads of hisgrey jacket were almost iridescent. But more eye-catching still, hissmile. A practised smile, belonging on an actor, or a preacher.
Whichever, it was the expression of a man looking for converts.[DIALOGUE]"Can I be of help?" he said. His voice was resonant, and warm, buthis sudden appearance had chilled Cal.[DIALOGUE]"Help me?"he said, floundering.[DIALOGUE]"Are you perhaps interested in purchasing property?"said.the other man[DIALOGUE]"Purchasing? No ... I... was just... you know ... looking around."[DIALOGUE]"It's a fine house said the stranger, his smile as steady as asurgeon's handshake, and as antiseptic. "Do you know much abouthouses?" The line was spoken like its predecessors, without irony ormalice. When Cal didn't reply, the man said: I'm a salesman. My
[METAPHOR]name's Shadwell.[DIALOGUE]" He teased the calf-skin glove from histhick-fingered hand. "And yours?[DIALOGUE]""Cal Mooney.Calhoun, that is."The bare hand was extended. Cal took two steps towards the man he wasfully four inches taller than Cal's five foot eleven- and shook hands.
[SURPRISE][ACTION][CONFLICT][METAPHOR]The man's cool palm made Cal aware that he was sweating like aPig The handshake broken, friend Shadwell unbuttoned his jacket, andopened it, to take a pen from his inside pocket. This casual actionbriefly revealed the lining of the Salesman's garment, and by sometrick of the light it seemed to shine, as though the fabric were wovenof mirrored threads.Shadwell caught the look on Cal's face. His voice was feather-light ashe said: [DIALOGUE]"Do you see anything you like?" Cal didn't trust the man.
[SURPRISE][PROBLEM][METAPHOR]Was it the smile or the calfskin gloves that made him suspicious?Whichever, he wanted as little time in the man's company as possible.But there was something in the jacket. Something that caught thelight, and made Cal's heart beat a little faster.
[TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][CONFLICT][DIALOGUE]"Please ..." Shadwell coaxed. [DIALOGUE]"Have a look." His hand went to thejacket again, and opened \fe [DIALOGUE]"Tell me ..." he purred, '... if there's
[EXPOSITION][PERSPECTIVE][TRANSITION][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE]anything there that takes your fancy."This time, he fully opened the jacket, exposing the lining.Cal's first judgement had been correct. It did shine.
[DIALOGUE]"I am, as I said, a salesman," Shadwell was explaining.And yes,[DIALOGUE]"I make it a Golden Rule always to carry some samples of mymerchandise around with me."Merchandise. Cal shaped the word in his head, his eyes still fixed onthe interior of the jacket. What a word that was: merchandise. And
[CONFLICT]there, in the lining of the jacket, he could almost see that word madesolid. Jewellery, was it, that gleamed there? Artificial gems with asheen that blinded the way only the fake could. He squinted into theglamour, looking to make sense out of what he saw, while the Salesman'svoice went about its persuasions:Tell me what you'd like and it's yours. I can't say fairer than that,
[TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][CHARACTER][EXPOSITION][CONTEXT][SETTING]can I? A fine young man like you should be able to pick and choose.The world's your oyster. I can see that. Open in front of you. Have

[SURPRISE][METAPHOR][FLASHBACK][CONFLICT][PERSPECTIVE]the Salesman said,[DIALOGUE]"... what you see/Ah, there was a question '... and it's yours."He saw forgotten treasures, things he'd once upon a time set his heartupon, thinking that if he owned them he'd never want for anythingagain. Worthless trinkets, most of them, but items that awoke oldlongings. A pair of X-ray spectacles he'd seen advertised at the backof a comic book (see thru walls! impress your friends!) but had never
[FLASHBACK]been able to buy. There they were now, their plastic lens gleaming,and seeing them he remembered the October nights he'd lain awakewondering how they worked.And what was that beside them?Another childhoodfetish. A photograph of a woman dressed only in stiletto heels and a
[CONFLICT][FLASHBACK][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][TRANSITION]sequin ned G-string, presenting her over-sized breasts to the viewer.The boy two doors down from Cal had owned that picture, stolen it fromhis uncle's wallet, he'd claimed, and Cal had wanted it so badly hethought he'd die of longing. Now it hung, a dog-eared memento, in theglittering flux of Shadwell's jacket, there for the asking.But no sooner had it made itself apparent than it too faded, and newprizes appeared in its place to tempt him.
[SURPRISE][DIALOGUE]"What is it you see, my friend?"The keys to a car he'd longed to own. A prize pigeon, the winner ofinnumerable races, that he'd been so envious of he'd have happilyabducted '. just tell me what you see. Ask, and it's yours/There was so much. Items that had seemed- for an hour, a day the pivot
[SURPRISE][TRANSITION][PROBLEM]upon which his world turned, all hung now in the miraculous store-roomof the Salesman's coat.But they were fugitive, all of them. They appeared only to evaporateagain. There was something else there, which prevented thesetrivialities from holding his attention for more than moments. What it
[EMOTION]was, he couldn't yet see.He was dimly aware that Shadwell was addressing him again, and that thetone of the Salesman's voice had altered. There was some puzzlement init now, tinged with exasperation.[DIALOGUE]"Speak up, my friend ... why don't you tell me what you want?"[DIALOGUE]"I can't... quite .. . see it."[DIALOGUE]"Then try harder.Concentrate."Cal tried.

It had becomea challenge to see past the tinsel to the real treasure that laybeyond. A curious sensation attended this focusing; a restlessness inhis chest and throat, as though some part of him were preparing to begone; out of him and along the line of his gaze. Gone into thejacket.
[DANGER][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][SURPRISE]At the back of his head, where his skull grew the tail of his spine,the warning voices muttered on. But he was too committed to resist.Whatever the lining contained, it teased him, not quite showing itself.He stared and stared, defying its decorum until the sweat ran from histemples.
[PROBLEM][TRANSITION][WEAPON][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][CONFLICT][DANGER]Shadwell's coaxing monologue had gained fresh confidence. Its sugarcoating had cracked and fallen away. The nut beneath was bitter anddark.[DIALOGUE]"Go on ..." he said. "Don't be so damn weak. There's something here

He was trapped. Yetdangerous as things had become, he felt inwardly elated. His
