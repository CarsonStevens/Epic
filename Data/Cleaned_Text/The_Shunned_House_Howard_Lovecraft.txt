[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][CONFLICT][HORROR]                        The                             Shunned House                        By H. P. LOVECRAFT _A posthumous story of immense power, written by a master of weird   fiction--a tale of a revolting horror in the cellar of an old                       house in New England_    Howard Phillips Lovecraft died last March, at the height of his    career. Though only forty-six years of age, he had built up an    international reputation by the artistry and impeccable literary    craftsmanship of his weird tales; and he was regarded on both sides    of the Atlantic as probably the greatest contemporary master of    weird fiction. His ability to create and sustain a mood of brooding
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][TRANSITION][HAUNTED HOUSE]    dread and unnamable horror is nowhere better shown than in the    posthumous tale presented here: [DIALOGUE]"The Shunned House."From even the greatest of horrors irony is seldom absent. Sometimes itenters directly into the composition of the events, while sometimes itrelates only to their fortuitous position among persons and places. Thelatter sort is splendidly exemplified by a case in the ancient city ofProvidence, where in the late forties Edgar Allan Poe used to sojournoften during his unsuccessful wooing of the gifted poetess, Mrs.Whitman. Poe generally stopped at the Mansion House in BenefitStreet--the renamed Golden Ball Inn whose roof has sheltered Washington,Jefferson, and Lafayette--and his favorite walk led northward along thesame street to Mrs. Whitman's home and the neighboring hillsidechurchyard of St. John's, whose hidden expanse of Eighteenth Century
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][FLASHBACK][CONTEXT][PERSPECTIVE][EXPOSITION][CHARACTERIZATION][SUSPENSE][TRANSITION][DANGER][HORROR]gravestones had for him a peculiar fascination.Now the irony is this. In this walk, so many times repeated, the world'sgreatest master of the terrible and the bizarre was obliged to pass aparticular house on the eastern side of the street; a dingy, antiquatedstructure perched on the abruptly rising side hill, with a great unkemptyard dating from a time when the region was partly open country. It doesnot appear that he ever wrote or spoke of it, nor is there any evidencethat he even noticed it. And yet that house, to the two persons in
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][METAPHOR][PERSPECTIVE][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][HORROR]possession of certain information, equals or outranks in horror thewildest fantasy of the genius who so often passed it unknowingly, andstands starkly leering as a symbol of all that is unutterably hideous.The house was--and for that matter still is--of a kind to attract theattention of the curious. Originally a farm or semi-farm building, itfollowed the average New England colonial lines of the middle EighteenthCentury--the prosperous peaked-roof sort, with two stories anddormerless attic, and with the Georgian doorway and interior panellingdictated by the progress of taste at that time. It faced south, with onegable end buried to the lower windows in the eastward rising hill, andthe other exposed to the foundations toward the street. Its
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT]construction, over a century and a half ago, had followed the gradingand straightening of the road in that especial vicinity; for BenefitStreet--at first called Back Street--was laid out as a lane windingamongst the graveyards of the first settlers, and straightened only whenthe removal of the bodies to the North Burial Ground made it decentlypossible to cut through the old family plots.At the start, the western wall had lain some twenty feet up aprecipitous lawn from the roadway; but a widening of the street at aboutthe time of the Revolution sheared off most of the intervening space,exposing the foundations so that a brick basement wall had to be made,giving the deep cellar a street frontage with door and one window aboveground, close to the new line of public travel. When the sidewalk waslaid out a century ago the last of the intervening space was removed;and Poe in his walks must have seen only a sheer ascent of dull graybrick flush with the sidewalk and surmounted at a height of ten feet bythe antique shingled bulk of the house proper.[Illustration: [DIALOGUE]"That awful door in Benefit Street which I had leftajar."]The farm-like ground extended back very deeply up the hill, almost toWheaton Street. The space south of the house, abutting on Benefit
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][DANGER][PROBLEM][FLASHBACK][METAPHOR][HAUNTED HOUSE]Street, was of course greatly above the existing sidewalk level, forminga terrace bounded by a high bank wall of damp, mossy stone pierced by asteep flight of narrow steps which led inward between canyon-likesurfaces to the upper region of mangy lawn, rheumy brick walks, andneglected gardens whose dismantled cement urns, rusted kettles fallenfrom tripods of knotty sticks, and similar paraphernalia set off theweather-beaten front door with its broken fanlight, rotting Ionicpilasters, and wormy triangular pediment.       *       *       *       *       *What I heard in my youth about the shunned house was merely that peopledied there in alarmingly great numbers. That, I was told, was why theoriginal owners had moved out some twenty years after building theplace. It was plainly unhealthy, perhaps because of the dampness andfungous growths in the cellar, the general sickish smell, the drafts ofthe hallways, or the quality of the well and pump water. These things
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT]were bad enough, and these were all that gained belief among the personswhom I knew. Only the notebooks of my antiquarian uncle, Doctor ElihuWhipple, revealed to me at length the darker, vaguer surmises whichformed an undercurrent of folklore among old-time servants and humblefolk; surmises which never travelled far, and which were largelyforgotten when Providence grew to be a metropolis with a shifting modernpopulation.The general fact is, that the house was never regarded by the solid partof the community as in any real sense [DIALOGUE]"haunted." There were nowidespread tales of rattling chains, cold currents of air, extinguishedlights, or faces at the window. Extremists sometimes said the house was[DIALOGUE]"unlucky," but that is as far as even they went. What was really beyond
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT]dispute is that a frightful proportion of persons died there; or moreaccurately, _had_ died there, since after some peculiar happenings oversixty years ago the building had become deserted through the sheerimpossibility of renting it. These persons were not all cut off suddenlyby any one cause; rather did it seem that their vitality was insidiouslysapped, so that each one died the sooner from whatever tendency toweakness he may have naturally had. And those who did not die displayedin varying degree a type of anemia or consumption, and sometimes adecline of the mental faculties, which spoke ill for the salubriousnessof the building. Neighboring houses, it must be added, seemed entirelyfree from the noxious quality.
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][FLASHBACK][PROBLEM][HAUNTED HOUSE]This much I knew before my insistent questioning led my uncle to show methe notes which finally embarked us both on our hideous investigation.In my childhood the shunned house was vacant, with barren, gnarled andterrible old trees, long, queerly pale grass and nightmarishly misshapenweeds in the high terraced yard where birds never lingered. We boys usedto overrun the place, and I can still recall my youthful terror not onlyat the morbid strangeness of this sinister vegetation, but at theeldritch atmosphere and odor of the dilapidated house, whose unlockedfront door was often entered in quest of shudders. The small-panedwindows were largely broken, and a nameless air of desolation hung roundthe precarious panelling, shaky interior shutters, peeling wall-paper,falling plaster, rickety staircases, and such fragments of batteredfurniture as still remained. The dust and cobwebs added their touch of
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][DANGER][SURPRISE][HAUNTED HOUSE]the fearful; and brave indeed was the boy who would voluntarily ascendthe ladder to the attic, a vast raftered length lighted only by smallblinking windows in the gable ends, and filled with a massed wreckageof chests, chairs, and spinning-wheels which infinite years of deposithad shrouded and festooned into monstrous and hellish shapes.But after all, the attic was not the most terrible part of the house. Itwas the dank, humid cellar which somehow exerted the strongest repulsionon us, even though it was wholly above ground on the street side, withonly a thin door and window-pierced brick wall to separate it from thebusy sidewalk. We scarcely knew whether to haunt it in spectralfascination, or to shun it for the sake of our souls and our sanity. For
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][PROBLEM][CONFLICT]one thing, the bad odor of the house was strongest there; and foranother thing, we did not like the white fungous growths whichoccasionally sprang up in rainy summer weather from the hard earthfloor. Those fungi, grotesquely like the vegetation in the yard outside,were truly horrible in their outlines; detestable parodies of toadstoolsand Indian-pipes, whose like we had never seen in any other situation.They rotted quickly, and at one stage became slightly phosphorescent; sothat nocturnal passers-by sometimes spoke of witch-fires glowing behindthe broken panes of the fetor-spreading windows.We never--even in our wildest Halloween moods--visited this cellarby night, but in some of our daytime visits could detect thephosphorescence, especially when the day was dark and wet. There was
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][SURPRISE][EMOTION][METAPHOR][PERSPECTIVE]also a subtler thing we often thought we detected--a very strange thingwhich was, however, merely suggestive at most. I refer to a sort ofcloudy whitish pattern on the dirt floor--a vague, shifting deposit ofmold or niter which we sometimes thought we could trace amidst thesparse fungous growths near the huge fireplace of the basement kitchen.Once in a while it struck us that this patch bore an uncanny resemblanceto a doubled-up human figure, though generally no such kinship existed,and often there was no whitish deposit whatever.On a certain rainy afternoon when this illusion seemed phenomenallystrong, and when, in addition, I had fancied I glimpsed a kind of thin,yellowish, shimmering exhalation rising from the nitrous pattern towardthe yawning fireplace, I spoke to my uncle about the matter. He smiled
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][PERSPECTIVE][CONTEXT][HAUNTED HOUSE]at this odd conceit, but it seemed that his smile was tinged withreminiscence. Later I heard that a similar notion entered into some ofthe wild ancient tales of the common folk--a notion likewise alluding toghoulish, wolfish shapes taken by smoke from the great chimney, andqueer contours assumed by certain of the sinuous tree-roots that thrusttheir way into the cellar through the loose foundation-stones.2Not till my adult years did my uncle set before me the notes and datawhich he had collected concerning the shunned house. Doctor Whipple wasa sane, conservative physician of the old school, and for all hisinterest in the place was not eager to encourage young thoughts towardthe abnormal. His own view, postulating simply a building and location
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT]of markedly unsanitary qualities, had nothing to do with abnormality;but he realized that the very picturesqueness which aroused his owninterest would in a boy's fanciful mind take on all manner of gruesomeimaginative associations.The doctor was a bachelor; a white-haired, clean-shaven, old-fashionedgentleman, and a local historian of note, who had often broken a lancewith such controversial guardians of tradition as Sidney S. Rider andThomas W. Bicknell. He lived with one man-servant in a Georgian
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][SURPRISE][HAUNTED HOUSE]homestead with knocker and iron-railed steps, balanced eerily on thesteep ascent of North Court Street beside the ancient brick court andcolony house where his grandfather--a cousin of that celebratedprivateersman, Captain Whipple, who burnt His Majesty's armed schooner_Gaspee_ in 1772--had voted in the legislature on May 4, 1776, for theindependence of the Rhode Island Colony. Around him in the damp,low-ceiled library with the musty white panelling, heavy carvedovermantel and small-paned, vine-shaded windows, were the relics andrecords of his ancient family, among which were many dubious allusionsto the shunned house in Benefit Street. That pest spot lies not fardistant--for Benefit runs ledgewise just above the court house along theprecipitous hill up which the first settlement climbed.When, in the end, my insistent pestering and maturing years evoked frommy uncle the hoarded lore I sought, there lay before me a strange enoughchronicle. Long-winded, statistical, and drearily genealogical as some
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][HORROR]of the matter was, there ran through it a continuous thread of brooding,tenacious horror and preternatural malevolence which impressed me evenmore than it had impressed the good doctor. Separate events fittedtogether uncannily, and seemingly irrelevant details held mines ofhideous possibilities. A new and burning curiosity grew in me, comparedto which my boyish curiosity was feeble and inchoate.The first revelation led to an exhaustive research, and finally to thatshuddering quest which proved so disastrous to myself and mine. For at
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][CHARACTER]the last my uncle insisted on joining the search I had commenced, andafter a certain night in that house he did not come away with me. I amlonely without that gentle soul whose long years were filled only withhonor, virtue, good taste, benevolence, and learning. I have reared amarble urn to his memory in St. John's churchyard--the place that Poeloved--the hidden grove of giant willows on the hill, where tombs andheadstones huddle quietly between the hoary bulk of the church and thehouses and bank walls of Benefit Street.
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT]The history of the house, opening amidst a maze of dates, revealed notrace of the sinister either about its construction or about theprosperous and honorable family who built it. Yet from the first a taintof calamity, soon increased to boding significance, was apparent. Myuncle's carefully compiled record began with the building of thestructure in 1763, and followed the theme with an unusual amount ofdetail. The shunned house, it seems, was first inhabited by WilliamHarris and his wife Rhoby Dexter, with their children, Elkanah, born in1755, Abigail, born in 1757, William, Jr., born in 1759, and Ruth, bornin 1761. Harris was a substantial merchant and seaman in the West India
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][TRANSITION]trade, connected with the firm of Obadiah Brown and his nephews. AfterBrown's death in 1761, the new firm of Nicholas Brown & Company made himmaster of the brig _Prudence_, Providence-built, of 120 tons, thusenabling him to erect the new homestead he had desired ever since hismarriage.The site he had chosen--a recently straightened part of the new andfashionable Back Street, which ran along the side of the hill abovecrowded Cheapside--was all that could be wished, and the building didjustice to the location. It was the best that moderate means couldafford, and Harris hastened to move in before the birth of a fifth childwhich the family expected. That child, a boy, came in December; but was
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][DANGER][PROBLEM][DEATH][SURPRISE][CONTEXT]still-born. Nor was any child to be born alive in that house for acentury and a half.The next April, sickness occurred among the children, and Abigail andRuth died before the month was over. Doctor Job Ives diagnosed thetrouble as some infantile fever, though others declared it was more of amere wasting-away or decline. It seemed, in any event, to be contagious;
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][DEATH][CONFLICT][PROBLEM]for Hannah Bowen, one of the two servants, died of it in the followingJune. Eli Lideason, the other servant, constantly complained ofweakness; and would have returned to his father's farm in Rehoboth butfor a sudden attachment for Mehitabel Pierce, who was hired to succeedHannah. He died the next year--a sad year indeed, since it marked thedeath of William Harris himself, enfeebled as he was by the climate ofMartinique, where his occupation had kept him for considerable periodsduring the preceding decade.The widowed Rhoby Harris never recovered from the shock of her husband'sdeath, and the passing of her first-born Elkanah two years later was thefinal blow to her reason. In 1768 she fell victim to a mild form of
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][CONFLICT][DEATH]insanity, and was thereafter confined to the upper part of the house;her elder maiden sister, Mercy Dexter, having moved in to take charge ofthe family. Mercy was a plain, raw-boned woman of great strength; buther health visibly declined from the time of her advent. She was greatlydevoted to her unfortunate sister, and had an especial affection for heronly surviving nephew William, who from a sturdy infant had become asickly, spindling lad. In this year the servant Mehitabel died, and theother servant, Preserved Smith, left without coherent explanation--or atleast, with only some wild tales and a complaint that he disliked thesmell of the place. For a time Mercy could secure no more help, since
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][DANGER][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][METAPHOR][WITCH]the seven deaths and case of madness, all occurring within five years'space, had begun to set in motion the body of fireside rumor which laterbecame so bizarre. Ultimately, however, she obtained new servants fromout of town; Ann White, a morose woman from that part of North Kingstownnow set off as the township of Exeter, and a capable Boston man namedZenas Low.       *       *       *       *       *It was Ann White who first gave definite shape to the sinister idletalk. Mercy should have known better than to hire anyone from theNooseneck Hill country, for that remote bit of backwoods was then, asnow, a seat of the most uncomfortable superstitions. As lately as 1892
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][CONFLICT][DANGER][METAPHOR][HORROR]an Exeter community exhumed a dead body and ceremoniously burnt itsheart in order to prevent certain alleged visitations injurious to thepublic health and peace, and one may imagine the point of view of thesame section in 1768. Ann's tongue was perniciously active, and within afew months Mercy discharged her, filling her place with a faithful andamiable Amazon from Newport, Maria Robbins.Meanwhile poor Rhoby Harris, in her madness, gave voice to dreams andimaginings of the most hideous sort. At times her screams becameinsupportable, and for long periods she would utter shrieking horrorswhich necessitated her son's temporary residence with his cousin, PelegHarris, in Presbyterian Lane near the new college building. The boy
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][SURPRISE][DEATH][EMOTION][CONFLICT][METAPHOR]would seem to improve after these visits, and had Mercy been as wise asshe was well-meaning, she would have let him live permanently withPeleg. Just what Mrs. Harris cried out in her fits of violence,tradition hesitates to say; or rather, presents such extravagantaccounts that they nullify themselves through sheer absurdity. Certainlyit sounds absurd to hear that a woman educated only in the rudiments ofFrench often shouted for hours in a coarse and idiomatic form of thatlanguage, or that the same person, alone and guarded, complained wildlyof a staring thing which bit and chewed at her. In 1772 the servantZenas died, and when Mrs. Harris heard of it she laughed with a shockingdelight utterly foreign to her. The next year she herself died, and was
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT]laid to rest in the North Burial Ground beside her husband.Upon the outbreak of trouble with Great Britain in 1775, William Harris,despite his scant sixteen years and feeble constitution, managed toenlist in the Army of Observation under General Greene; and from thattime on enjoyed a steady rise in health and prestige. In 1780, as acaptain in the Rhode Island forces in New Jersey under Colonel Angell,he met and married Phebe Hetfield of Elizabethtown, whom he brought toProvidence upon his honorable discharge in the following year.The young soldier's return was not a thing of unmitigated happiness. The
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][TRANSITION][ACTION]house, it is true, was still in good condition; and the street had beenwidened and changed in name from Back Street to Benefit Street. ButMercy Dexter's once robust frame had undergone a sad and curious decay,so that she was now a stooped and pathetic figure with hollow voice anddisconcerting pallor--qualities shared to a singular degree by the oneremaining servant Maria. In the autumn of 1782 Phebe Harris gave birthto a still-born daughter, and on the fifteenth of the next May MercyDexter took leave of a useful, austere, and virtuous life.William Harris, at last thoroughly convinced of the radicallyunhealthful nature of his abode, now took steps toward quitting it andclosing it for ever. Securing temporary quarters for himself and his
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][ACTION][CONFLICT][TRANSITION]wife at the newly opened Golden Ball Inn, he arranged for the buildingof a new and finer house in Westminster Street, in the growing part ofthe town across the Great Bridge. There, in 1785, his son Dutee wasborn; and there the family dwelt till the encroachments of commercedrove them back across the river and over the hill to Angell Street, inthe newer East Side residence district, where the late Archer Harrisbuilt his sumptuous but hideous French-roofed mansion in 1876. Williamand Phebe both succumbed to the yellow fever epidemic of 1797, but Duteewas brought up by his cousin Rathbone Harris, Peleg's son.Rathbone was a practical man, and rented the Benefit Street housedespite William's wish to keep it vacant. He considered it an obligation
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT]to his ward to make the most of all the boy's property, nor did heconcern himself with the deaths and illnesses which caused so manychanges of tenants, or the steadily growing aversion with which thehouse was generally regarded. It is likely that he felt only vexationwhen, in 1804, the town council ordered him to fumigate the place withsulfur, tar, and gum camphor on account of the much-discussed deaths offour persons, presumably caused by the then diminishing fever epidemic.They said the place had a febrile smell.Dutee himself thought little of the house, for he grew up to be aprivateersman, and served with distinction on the _Vigilant_ underCaptain Cahoone in the War of 1812. He returned unharmed, married in
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][METAPHOR][SURPRISE][DEATH][DANGER][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][CONTEXT][PERSPECTIVE][CHARACTERIZATION][HAUNTED HOUSE]1814, and became a father on that memorable night of September 23, 1815,when a great gale drove the waters of the bay over half the town, andfloated a tall sloop well up Westminster Street so that its masts almosttapped the Harris windows in symbolic affirmation that the new boy,Welcome, was a seaman's son.Welcome did not survive his father, but lived to perish gloriously atFredericksburg in 1862. Neither he nor his son Archer knew of theshunned house as other than a nuisance almost impossible torent--perhaps on account of the mustiness and sickly odor of unkempt oldage. Indeed, it never was rented after a series of deaths culminating in1861, which the excitement of the war tended to throw into obscurity.
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][METAPHOR][TRANSITION][CHARACTER][FLASHBACK][HORROR]Carrington Harris, last of the male line, knew it only as a deserted andsomewhat picturesque center of legend until I told him my experience. Hehad meant to tear it down and build an apartment house on the site, butafter my account decided to let it stand, install plumbing, and rent it.Nor has he yet had any difficulty in obtaining tenants. The horror hasgone.
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT]3It may well be imagined how powerfully I was affected by the annals ofthe Harrises. In this continuous record there seemed to me to brood apersistent evil beyond anything in nature as I had known it; an evilclearly connected with the house and not with the family. Thisimpression was confirmed by my uncle's less systematic array ofmiscellaneous data--legends transcribed from servant gossip, cuttingsfrom the papers, copies of death certificates by fellow-physicians, andthe like. All of this material I cannot hope to give, for my uncle was atireless antiquarian and very deeply interested in the shunned house;but I may refer to several dominant points which earn notice by theirrecurrence through many reports from diverse sources. For example, the
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT]servant gossip was practically unanimous in attributing to the fungousand malodorous _cellar_ of the house a vast supremacy in evil influence.There had been servants--Ann White especially--who would not use thecellar kitchen, and at least three well-defined legends bore upon thequeer quasi-human or diabolic outlines assumed by tree-roots and patchesof mold in that region. These latter narratives interested meprofoundly, on account of what I had seen in my boyhood, but I felt thatmost of the significance had in each case been largely obscured byadditions from the common stock of local ghost lore.Ann White, with her Exeter superstition, had promulgated the mostextravagant and at the same time most consistent tale; alleging thatthere must lie buried beneath the house one of those vampires--the deadwho retain their bodily form and live on the blood or breath of theliving--whose hideous legions send their preying shapes or spiritsabroad by night. To destroy a vampire one must, the grandmothers say,
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT]exhume it and burn its heart, or at least drive a stake through thatorgan; and Ann's dogged insistence on a search under the cellar had beenprominent in bringing about her discharge.Her tales, however, commanded a wide audience, and were the more readilyaccepted because the house indeed stood on land once used for burialpurposes. To me their interest depended less on this circumstance thanon the peculiarly appropriate way in which they dovetailed with certainother things--the complaint of the departing servant Preserved Smith,who had preceded Ann and never heard of her, that something [DIALOGUE]"sucked hisbreath" at night; the death-certificates of the fever victims of 1804,issued by Doctor Chad Hopkins, and showing the four deceased persons allunaccountably lacking in blood; and the obscure passages of poor RhobyHarris's ravings, where she complained of the sharp teeth of aglassy-eyed, half-visible presence.Free from unwarranted superstition though I am, these things produced inme an odd sensation, which was intensified by a pair of widely separatednewspaper cuttings relating to deaths in the shunned house--one from the_Providence Gazette and Country-Journal_ of April 12, 1815, and theother from the _Daily Transcript and Chronicle_ of October 27,1845--each of which detailed an appallingly grisly circumstance whoseduplication was remarkable. It seems that in both instances the dying
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][DEATH][HAUNTED HOUSE]person, in 1815 a gentle old lady named Stafford and in 1845 aschoolteacher of middle age named Eleazar Durfee, became transfigured ina horrible way, glaring glassily and attempting to bite the throat ofthe attending physician. Even more puzzling, though, was the final casewhich put an end to the renting of the house--a series of anemia deathspreceded by progressive madnesses wherein the patient would craftilyattempt the lives of his relatives by incisions in the neck or wrist.This was in 1860 and 1861, when my uncle had just begun his medicalpractise; and before leaving for the front he heard much of it from hiselder professional colleagues. The really inexplicable thing was the wayin which the victims--ignorant people, for the ill-smelling and widelyshunned house could now be rented to no others--would babblemaledictions in French, a language they could not possibly have studiedto any extent. It made one think of poor Rhoby Harris nearly a century
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT]before, and so moved my uncle that he commenced collecting historicaldata on the house after listening, some time subsequent to his returnfrom the war, to the first-hand account of Doctors Chase and Whitmarsh.Indeed, I could see that my uncle had thought deeply on the subject, andthat he was glad of my own interest--an open-minded and sympatheticinterest which enabled him to discuss with me matters at which otherswould merely have laughed. His fancy had not gone so far as mine, but hefelt that the place was rare in its imaginative potentialities, andworthy of note as an inspiration in the field of the grotesque andmacabre.For my part, I was disposed to take the whole subject with profoundseriousness, and began at once not only to review the evidence, but toaccumulate as much more as I could. I talked with the elderly Archer
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK][CONTEXT]Harris, then owner of the house, many times before his death in 1916;and obtained from him and his still surviving maiden sister Alice anauthentic corroboration of all the family data my uncle had collected.When, however, I asked them what connection with France or its languagethe house could have, they confessed themselves as frankly baffled andignorant as I. Archer knew nothing, and all that Miss Harris could saywas that an old allusion her grandfather, Dutee Harris, had heard ofmight have shed a little light. The old seaman, who had survived his sonWelcome's death in battle by two years, had not himself known thelegend, but recalled that his earliest nurse, the ancient Maria Robbins,seemed darkly aware of something that might have lent a weirdsignificance to the French raving of Rhoby Harris, which she had sooften heard during the last days of that hapless woman. Maria had been
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][DEATH][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][CONTEXT][PROBLEM][HAUNTED HOUSE]at the shunned house from 1769 till the removal of the family in 1783,and had seen Mercy Dexter die. Once she hinted to the child Dutee of asomewhat peculiar circumstance in Mercy's last moments, but he had soonforgotten all about it save that it was something peculiar. Thegranddaughter, moreover, recalled even this much with difficulty. Sheand her brother were not so much interested in the house as was Archer'sson Carrington, the present owner, with whom I talked after myexperience.
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][TRANSITION]       *       *       *       *       *Having exhausted the Harris family of all the information it couldfurnish, I turned my attention to early town records and deeds with azeal more penetrating than that which my uncle had occasionally shown inthe same work. What I wished was a comprehensive history of the sitefrom its very settlement in 1636--or even before, if any NarragansettIndian legend could be unearthed to supply the data. I found, at thestart, that the land had been part of the long strip of home lot grantedoriginally to John Throckmorton; one of many similar strips beginning atthe Town Street beside the river and extending up over the hill to aline roughly corresponding with the modern Hope Street. The Throckmortonlot had later, of course, been much subdivided; and I became veryassiduous in tracing that section through which Back or Benefit Streetwas later run. It had, as rumor indeed said, been the Throckmorton
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][SURPRISE][DANGER][CONTEXT][TRANSITION][CONFLICT][PERSPECTIVE][FLASHBACK][HORROR]graveyard; but as I examined the records more carefully, I found thatthe graves had all been transferred at an early date to the North BurialGround on the Pawtucket West Road.Then suddenly I came--by a rare piece of chance, since it was not in themain body of records and might easily have been missed--upon somethingwhich aroused my keenest eagerness, fitting in as it did with several ofthe queerest phases of the affair. It was the record of a lease, in1697, of a small tract of ground to an Etienne Roulet and wife. At lastthe French element had appeared--that, and another deeper element ofhorror which the name conjured up from the darkest recesses of my weirdand heterogeneous reading--and I feverishly studied the platting of thelocality as it had been before the cutting through and partialstraightening of Back Street between 1747 and 1758. I found what I had
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][SURPRISE]half expected, that where the shunned house now stood the Roulets hadlaid out their graveyard behind a one-story and attic cottage, and thatno record of any transfer of graves existed. The document, indeed, endedin much confusion; and I was forced to ransack both the Rhode IslandHistorical Society and Shepley Library before I could find a local doorwhich the name of Etienne Roulet would unlock. In the end I did findsomething; something of such vague but monstrous import that I set aboutat once to examine the cellar of the shunned house itself with a new andexcited minuteness.The Roulets, it seemed, had come in 1696 from East Greenwich, down thewest shore of Narragansett Bay. They were Huguenots from Caude, and had
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT]encountered much opposition before the Providence selectmen allowed themto settle in the town. Unpopularity had dogged them in East Greenwich,whither they had come in 1686, after the revocation of the Edict ofNantes, and rumor said that the cause of dislike extended beyond mereracial and national prejudice, or the land disputes which involved otherFrench settlers with the English in rivalries which not even GovernorAndros could quell. But their ardent Protestantism--too ardent, somewhispered--and their evident distress when virtually driven from thevillage down the bay, had moved the sympathy of the town fathers. Herethe strangers had been granted a haven; and the swarthy Etienne Roulet,less apt at agriculture than at reading queer books and drawing queerdiagrams, was given a clerical post in the warehouse at PardonTillinghast's wharf, far south in Town Street. There had, however, been
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT]a riot of some sort later on--perhaps forty years later, after oldRoulet's death--and no one seemed to hear of the family after that.For a century and more, it appeared, the Roulets had been wellremembered and frequently discussed as vivid incidents in the quietlife of a New England seaport. Etienne's son Paul, a surly fellow whoseerratic conduct had probably provoked the riot which wiped out thefamily, was particularly a source of speculation; and though Providencenever shared the witchcraft panics of her Puritan neighbors, it wasfreely intimated by old wives that his prayers were neither uttered atthe proper time nor directed toward the proper object. All this hadundoubtedly formed the basis of the legend known by old Maria Robbins.
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][DEATH][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][MURDER]What relation it had to the French ravings of Rhoby Harris and otherinhabitants of the shunned house, imagination or future discovery alonecould determine. I wondered how many of those who had known the legendsrealized that additional link with the terrible which my wider readinghad given me; that ominous item in the annals of morbid horror whichtells of the creature _Jacques Roulet, of Caude_, who in 1598 wascondemned to death as a demoniac but afterward saved from the stake bythe Paris parliament and shut in a madhouse. He had been found coveredwith blood and shreds of flesh in a wood, shortly after the killing andrending of a boy by a pair of wolves. One wolf was seen to lope awayunhurt. Surely a pretty hearthside tale, with a queer significance as to
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][HAUNTED HOUSE]name and place; but I decided that the Providence gossips could not havegenerally known of it. Had they known, the coincidence of names wouldhave brought some drastic and frightened action--indeed, might not itslimited whispering have precipitated the final riot which erased theRoulets from the town?       *       *       *       *       *I now visited the accursed place with increased frequency; studying theunwholesome vegetation of the garden, examining all the walls of thebuilding, and poring over every inch of the earthen cellar floor.Finally, with Carrington Harris's permission, I fitted a key to thedisused door opening from the cellar directly upon Benefit Street,preferring to have a more immediate access to the outside world than thedark stairs, ground-floor hall, and front door could give. There, where
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT]morbidity lurked most thickly, I searched and poked during longafternoons when the sunlight filtered in through the cobwebbedabove-ground windows, and a sense of security glowed from the unlockeddoor which placed me only a few feet from the placid sidewalk outside.Nothing new rewarded my efforts--only the same depressing mustiness andfaint suggestions of noxious odors and nitrous outlines on thefloor--and I fancy that many pedestrians must have watched me curiouslythrough the broken panes.At length, upon a suggestion of my uncle's, I decided to try the spotnocturnally; and one stormy midnight ran the beams of an electric torchover the moldy floor with its uncanny shapes and distorted,half-phosphorescent fungi. The place had dispirited me curiously thatevening, and I was almost prepared when I saw--or thought I saw--amidstthe whitish deposits a particularly sharp definition of the [DIALOGUE]"huddledform" I had suspected from boyhood. Its clearness was astonishing and
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][DANGER][FLASHBACK][PROBLEM][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][HORROR]unprecedented--and as I watched I seemed to see again the thin,yellowish, shimmering exhalation which had startled me on that rainyafternoon so many years before.Above the anthropomorphic patch of mold by the fireplace it rose; asubtle, sickish, almost luminous vapor which as it hung trembling in thedampness seemed to develop vague and shocking suggestions of form,gradually trailing off into nebulous decay and passing up into theblackness of the great chimney with a fetor in its wake. It was trulyhorrible, and the more so to me because of what I knew of the spot.Refusing to flee, I watched it fade--and as I watched I felt that it wasin turn watching me greedily with eyes more imaginable than visible.
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][HAUNTED HOUSE]When I told my uncle about it he was greatly aroused; and after a tensehour of reflection, arrived at a definite and drastic decision. Weighingin his mind the importance of the matter, and the significance of ourrelation to it, he insisted that we both test--and if possibledestroy--the horror of the house by a joint night or nights ofaggressive vigil in that musty and fungus-cursed cellar.4On Wednesday, June 25, 1919, after a proper notification of CarringtonHarris which did not include surmises as to what we expected to find, myuncle and I conveyed to the shunned house two camp chairs and a foldingcamp cot, together with some scientific mechanism of greater weight andintricacy. These we placed in the cellar during the day, screening thewindows with paper and planning to return in the evening for our firstvigil. We had locked the door from the cellar to the ground floor; and
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][METAPHOR][CHARACTERIZATION][CONTEXT][CHARACTER]having a key to the outside cellar door, were prepared to leave ourexpensive and delicate apparatus--which we had obtained secretly and atgreat cost--as many days as our vigils might be protracted. It was ourdesign to sit up together till very late, and then watch singly tilldawn in two-hour stretches, myself first and then my companion; theinactive member resting on the cot.The natural leadership with which my uncle procured the instruments fromthe laboratories of Brown University and the Cranston Street Armory, andinstinctively assumed direction of our venture, was a marvelouscommentary on the potential vitality and resilience of a man ofeighty-one. Elihu Whipple had lived according to the hygienic laws hehad preached as a physician, and but for what happened later would behere in full vigor today. Only two persons suspected what did
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][CONTEXT][ACTION][PERSPECTIVE][CONFLICT][CHARACTER]happen--Carrington Harris and myself. I had to tell Harris because heowned the house and deserved to know what had gone out of it. Then too,we had spoken to him in advance of our quest; and I felt after myuncle's going that he would understand and assist me in some vitallynecessary public explanations. He turned very pale, but agreed to helpme, and decided that it would now be safe to rent the house.
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][METAPHOR][PERSPECTIVE]To declare that we were not nervous on that rainy night of watchingwould be an exaggeration both gross and ridiculous. We were not, as Ihave said, in any sense childishly superstitious, but scientific studyand reflection had taught us that the known universe of three dimensionsembraces the merest fraction of the whole cosmos of substance andenergy. In this case an overwhelming preponderance of evidence fromnumerous authentic sources pointed to the tenacious existence of certainforces of great power and, so far as the human point of view isconcerned, exceptional malignancy. To say that we actually believed invampires or werewolves would be a carelessly inclusive statement. Rather
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT]must it be said that we were not prepared to deny the possibility ofcertain unfamiliar and unclassified modifications of vital force andattenuated matter; existing very infrequently in three-dimensional spacebecause of its more intimate connection with other spatial units, yetclose enough to the boundary of our own to furnish us occasionalmanifestations which we, for lack of a proper vantage-point, may neverhope to understand.In short, it seemed to my uncle and me that an incontrovertible arrayof facts pointed to some lingering influence in the shunned house;traceable to one or another of the ill-favored French settlers of twocenturies before, and still operative through rare and unknown laws ofatomic and electronic motion. That the family of Roulet had possessed anabnormal affinity for outer circles of entity--dark spheres which fornormal folk hold only repulsion and terror--their recorded historyseemed to prove. Had not, then, the riots of those bygoneseventeen-thirties set moving certain kinetic patterns in the morbidbrain of one or more of them--notably the sinister Paul Roulet--whichobscurely survived the bodies murdered and buried by the mob, andcontinued to function in some multiple-dimensioned space along theoriginal lines of force determined by a frantic hatred of theencroaching community?
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][DANGER][MONSTER]Such a thing was surely not a physical or biochemical impossibility inthe light of a newer science which includes the theories of relativityand intra-atomic action. One might easily imagine an alien nucleus ofsubstance or energy, formless or otherwise, kept alive by imperceptibleor immaterial subtractions from the life-force or bodily tissue andfluids of other and more palpably living things into which it penetratesand with whose fabric it sometimes completely merges itself. It might beactively hostile, or it might be dictated merely by blind motives ofself-preservation. In any case such a monster must of necessity be inour scheme of things an anomaly and an intruder, whose extirpation formsa primary duty with every man not an enemy to the world's life, health,and sanity.
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][SURPRISE][PROBLEM]What baffled us was our utter ignorance of the aspect in which we mightencounter the thing. No sane person had ever seen it, and few had everfelt it definitely. It might be pure energy--a form ethereal and outsidethe realm of substance--or it might be partly material; some unknown andequivocal mass of plasticity, capable of changing at will to nebulousapproximations of the solid, liquid, gaseous, or tenuously unparticledstates. The anthropomorphic patch of mold on the floor, the form of theyellowish vapor, and the curvature of the tree-roots in some of the oldtales, all argued at least a remote and reminiscent connection with thehuman shape; but how representative or permanent that similarity mightbe, none could say with any kind of certainty.
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][FLASHBACK]       *       *       *       *       *We had devised two weapons to fight it; a large and specially fittedCrookes tube operated by powerful storage batteries and provided withpeculiar screens and reflectors, in case it proved intangible andopposable only by vigorously destructive ether radiations, and a pair ofmilitary flame-throwers of the sort used in the World War, in case itproved partly material and susceptible of mechanical destruction--forlike the superstitious Exeter rustics, we were prepared to burn thething's heart out if heart existed to burn. All this aggressivemechanism we set in the cellar in positions carefully arranged withreference to the cot and chairs, and to the spot before the fireplacewhere the mold had taken strange shapes. That suggestive patch, by theway, was only faintly visible when we placed our furniture andinstruments, and when we returned that evening for the actual vigil. Fora moment I half doubted that I had ever seen it in the more definitelylimned form--but then I thought of the legends.
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT]Our cellar vigil began at ten p. m., daylight saving time, and as itcontinued we found no promise of pertinent developments. A weak,filtered glow from the rain-harassed street-lamps outside, and a feeblephosphorescence from the detestable fungi within, showed the drippingstone of the walls, from which all traces of whitewash had vanished; thedank, fetid and mildew-tainted hard earth floor with its obscene fungi;the rotting remains of what had been stools, chairs, and tables, andother more shapeless furniture; the heavy planks and massive beams ofthe ground floor overhead; the decrepit plank door leading to bins andchambers beneath other parts of the house; the crumbling stone staircasewith ruined wooden hand-rail; and the crude and cavernous fireplace ofblackened brick where rusted iron fragments revealed the past presenceof hooks, andirons, spit, crane, and a door to the Dutch oven--thesethings, and our austere cot and camp chairs, and the heavy and intricatedestructive machinery we had brought.
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][DANGER][PERSPECTIVE]We had, as in my own former explorations, left the door to the streetunlocked; so that a direct and practical path of escape might lie openin case of manifestations beyond our power to deal with. It was our ideathat our continued nocturnal presence would call forth whatever malignentity lurked there; and that being prepared, we could dispose of thething with one or the other of our provided means as soon as we hadrecognized and observed it sufficiently. How long it might require toevoke and extinguish the thing, we had no notion. It occurred to us,too, that our venture was far from safe; for in what strength the thingmight appear no one could tell. But we deemed the game worth the hazard,
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][EMOTION][SURPRISE][CONFLICT][DANGER]and embarked on it alone and unhesitatingly; conscious that the seekingof outside aid would only expose us to ridicule and perhaps defeat ourentire purpose. Such was our frame of mind as we talked--far into thenight, till my uncle's growing drowsiness made me remind him to lie downfor his two-hour sleep.Something like fear chilled me as I sat there in the small hoursalone--I say alone, for one who sits by a sleeper is indeed alone;perhaps more alone than he can realize. My uncle breathed heavily, hisdeep inhalations and exhalations accompanied by the rain outside, andpunctuated by another nerve-racking sound of distant dripping waterwithin--for the house was repulsively damp even in dry weather, and inthis storm positively swamp-like. I studied the loose, antique masonry
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT]of the walls in the fungus-light and the feeble rays which stole in fromthe street through the screened window; and once, when the noisomeatmosphere of the place seemed about to sicken me, I opened the door andlooked up and down the street, feasting my eyes on familiar sights andmy nostrils on wholesome air. Still nothing occurred to reward mywatching; and I yawned repeatedly, fatigue getting the better ofapprehension.Then the stirring of my uncle in his sleep attracted my notice. He hadturned restlessly on the cot several times during the latter half of thefirst hour, but now he was breathing with unusual irregularity,occasionally heaving a sigh which held more than a few of the qualitiesof a choking moan.
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][SURPRISE][METAPHOR]I turned my electric flashlight on him and found his face averted; sorising and crossing to the other side of the cot, I again flashed thelight to see if he seemed in any pain. What I saw unnerved me mostsurprisingly, considering its relative triviality. It must have beenmerely the association of any odd circumstance with the sinister natureof our location and mission, for surely the circumstance was not initself frightful or unnatural. It was merely that my uncle's facialexpression, disturbed no doubt by the strange dreams which oursituation prompted, betrayed considerable agitation, and seemed not atall characteristic of him. His habitual expression was one of kindly and
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][EMOTION][CONFLICT][PERSPECTIVE][METAPHOR][TRANSITION][ALIEN]well-bred calm, whereas now a variety of emotions seemed strugglingwithin him. I think, on the whole, that it was this _variety_ whichchiefly disturbed me. My uncle, as he gasped and tossed in increasingperturbation and with eyes that had now started open, seemed not one butmany men, and suggested a curious quality of alienage from himself.       *       *       *       *       *All at once he commenced to mutter, and I did not like the look of hismouth and teeth as he spoke. The words were at first indistinguishable,
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][SURPRISE][TRANSITION][EMOTION][FLASHBACK]and then--with a tremendous start--I recognized something about themwhich filled me with icy fear till I recalled the breadth of my uncle'seducation and the interminable translations he had made fromanthropological and antiquarian articles in the _Revue des Deux Mondes_.For the venerable Elihu Whipple was muttering _in French_, and the fewphrases I could distinguish seemed connected with the darkest myths hehad ever adapted from the famous Paris magazine.Suddenly a perspiration broke out on the sleeper's forehead, and heleaped abruptly up, half awake. The jumble of French changed to a cry inEnglish, and the hoarse voice shouted excitedly, [DIALOGUE]"My breath, my breath!"Then the awakening became complete, and with a subsidence of facialexpression to the normal state my uncle seized my hand and began torelate a dream whose nucleus of significance I could only surmise with akind of awe.
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][SURPRISE][METAPHOR]He had, he said, floated off from a very ordinary series ofdream-pictures into a scene whose strangeness was related to nothing hehad ever read. It was of this world, and yet not of it--a shadowygeometrical confusion in which could be seen elements of familiar thingsin most unfamiliar and perturbing combinations. There was a suggestionof queerly disordered pictures superimposed one upon another; anarrangement in which the essentials of time as well as of space seemeddissolved and mixed in the most illogical fashion. In this kaleidoscopicvortex of phantasmal images were occasional snap-shots, if one might usethe term, of singular clearness but unaccountable heterogeneity.
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][SURPRISE][METAPHOR][EMOTION][CONFLICT][FLASHBACK][PERSPECTIVE][CHARACTERIZATION][TRANSITION][PROBLEM][DANGER]Once my uncle thought he lay in a carelessly dug open pit, with a crowdof angry faces framed by straggling locks and three-cornered hatsfrowning down on him. Again he seemed to be in the interior of ahouse--an old house, apparently--but the details and inhabitants wereconstantly changing, and he could never be certain of the faces or thefurniture, or even of the room itself, since doors and windows seemed injust as great a state of flux as the presumably more mobile objects. Itwas queer--damnably queer--and my uncle spoke almost sheepishly, as ifhalf expecting not to be believed, when he declared that of the strangefaces many had unmistakably borne the features of the Harris family. Andall the while there was a personal sensation of choking, as if somepervasive presence had spread itself through his body and sought topossess itself of his vital processes.
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][CONFLICT][HORROR]I shuddered at the thought of those vital processes, worn as they wereby eighty-one years of continuous functioning, in conflict with unknownforces of which the youngest and strongest system might well be afraid;but in another moment reflected that dreams are only dreams, and thatthese uncomfortable visions could be, at most, no more than my uncle'sreaction to the investigations and expectations which had lately filledour minds to the exclusion of all else.Conversation, also, soon tended to dispel my sense of strangeness; andin time I yielded to my yawns and took my turn at slumber. My uncleseemed now very wakeful, and welcomed his period of watching even thoughthe nightmare had aroused him far ahead of his allotted two hours.Sleep seized me quickly, and I was at once haunted with dreams of themost disturbing kind. I felt, in my visions, a cosmic and abysmal
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][CONFLICT][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE][DANGER][EMOTION][PROBLEM][TRANSITION][METAPHOR][CONTEXT][CHARACTERIZATION]loneness; with hostility surging from all sides upon some prison where Ilay confined. I seemed bound and gagged, and taunted by the echoingyells of distant multitudes who thirsted for my blood. My uncle's facecame to me with less pleasant association than in waking hours, and Irecall many futile struggles and attempts to scream. It was not apleasant sleep, and for a second I was not sorry for the echoing shriekwhich clove through the barriers of dream and flung me to a sharp andstartled awakeness in which every actual object before my eyes stood outwith more than natural clearness and reality.
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][PROBLEM][EMOTION][CONFLICT]5I had been lying with my face away from my uncle's chair, so that inthis sudden flash of awakening I saw only the door to the street, thewindow, and the wall and floor and ceiling toward the north of the room,all photographed with morbid vividness on my brain in a light brighterthan the glow of the fungi or the rays from the street outside. It wasnot a strong or even a fairly strong light; certainly not nearly strongenough to read an average book by. But it cast a shadow of myself andthe cot on the floor, and had a yellowish, penetrating force that hintedat things more potent than luminosity. This I perceived with unhealthysharpness despite the fact that two of my other senses were violentlyassailed. For on my ears rang the reverberations of that shocking
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][DANGER][SURPRISE][PROBLEM][CONFLICT][HORROR]scream, while my nostrils revolted at the stench which filled the place.My mind, as alert as my senses, recognized the gravely unusual; andalmost automatically I leaped up and turned about to grasp thedestructive instruments which we had left trained on the moldy spotbefore the fireplace. As I turned, I dreaded what I was to see; for thescream had been in my uncle's voice, and I knew not against what menaceI should have to defend him and myself.Yet after all, the sight was worse than I had dreaded. There are horrors
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][FLASHBACK][SURPRISE][PERSPECTIVE][DANGER][PROBLEM][METAPHOR][CONFLICT][TRANSITION]beyond horrors, and this was one of those nuclei of all dreamablehideousness which the cosmos saves to blast an accursed and unhappy few.Out of the fungus-ridden earth steamed up a vaporous corpse-light,yellow and diseased, which bubbled and lapped to a gigantic height invague outlines half human and half monstrous, through which I could seethe chimney and fireplace beyond. It was all eyes--wolfish andmocking--and the rugose insect-like head dissolved at the top to a thinstream of mist which curled putridly about and finally vanished up thechimney. I say that I saw this thing, but it is only in consciousretrospection that I ever definitely traced its damnable approach toform. At the time, it was to me only a seething, dimly phosphorescent
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][PERSPECTIVE][CHARACTER][EMOTION][CONFLICT][HORROR]cloud of fungous loathsomeness, enveloping and dissolving to anabhorrent plasticity the one object on which all my attention wasfocussed. That object was my uncle--the venerable Elihu Whipple--whowith blackening and decaying features leered and gibbered at me, andreached out dripping claws to rend me in the fury which this horror hadbrought.It was a sense of routine which kept me from going mad. I had drilledmyself in preparation for the crucial moment, and blind training savedme. Recognizing the bubbling evil as no substance reachable by matter or
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][DANGER][HORROR]material chemistry, and therefore ignoring the flame-thrower whichloomed on my left, I threw on the current of the Crookes tube apparatus,and focussed toward that scene of immortal blasphemousness the strongestether radiations which man's art can arouse from the spaces and fluidsof nature. There was a bluish haze and a frenzied sputtering, and theyellowish phosphorescence grew dimmer to my eyes. But I saw the dimnesswas only that of contrast, and that the waves from the machine had noeffect whatever.Then, in the midst of that demoniac spectacle, I saw a fresh horrorwhich brought cries to my lips and sent me fumbling and staggeringtoward that unlocked door to the quiet street, careless of what abnormalterrors I loosed upon the world, or what thoughts or judgments of men Ibrought down upon my head. In that dim blend of blue and yellow the form
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT]of my uncle had commenced a nauseous liquefaction whose essence eludesall description, and in which there played across his vanishing facesuch changes of identity as only madness can conceive. He was at once adevil and a multitude, a charnel-house and a pageant. Lit by the mixedand uncertain beams, that gelatinous face assumed a dozen--a score--ahundred--aspects; grinning, as it sank to the ground on a body thatmelted like tallow, in the caricatured likeness of legions strange andyet not strange.I saw the features of the Harris line, masculine and feminine, adult andinfantile, and other features old and young, coarse and refined,familiar and unfamiliar. For a second there flashed a degraded
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][METAPHOR][FLASHBACK][CONFLICT][TRANSITION][PERSPECTIVE][SURPRISE][EMOTION]counterfeit of a miniature of poor mad Rhoby Harris that I had seen inthe School of Design museum, and another time I thought I caught theraw-boned image of Mercy Dexter as I recalled her from a painting inCarrington Harris's house. It was frightful beyond conception; towardthe last, when a curious blend of servant and baby visages flickeredclose to the fungous floor where a pool of greenish grease wasspreading, it seemed as though the shifting features fought againstthemselves and strove to form contours like those of my uncle's kindlyface. I like to think that he existed at that moment, and that he triedto bid me farewell. It seems to me I hiccupped a farewell from my ownparched throat as I lurched out into the street; a thin stream of greasefollowing me through the door to the rain-drenched sidewalk.
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][HORROR]       *       *       *       *       *The rest is shadowy and monstrous. There was no one in the soakingstreet, and in all the world there was no one I dared tell. I walkedaimlessly south past College Hill and the AthenÃ¦um, down Hopkins Street,and over the bridge to the business section where tall buildings seemedto guard me as modern material things guard the world from ancient andunwholesome wonder. Then gray dawn unfolded wetly from the east,silhouetting the archaic hill and its venerable steeples, and beckoningme to the place where my terrible work was still unfinished. And in the
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT]end I went, wet, hatless, and dazed in the morning light, and enteredthat awful door in Benefit Street which I had left ajar, and which stillswung cryptically in full sight of the early householders to whom Idared not speak.The grease was gone, for the moldy floor was porous. And in front of thefireplace was no vestige of the giant doubled-up form traced in niter.I looked at the cot, the chairs, the instruments, my neglected hat, andthe yellowed straw hat of my uncle. Dazedness was uppermost, and I could
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK][PROBLEM][HORROR]scarcely recall what was dream and what was reality. Then thoughttrickled back, and I knew that I had witnessed things more horrible thanI had dreamed.Sitting down, I tried to conjecture as nearly as sanity would let mejust what had happened, and how I might end the horror, if indeed it hadbeen real. Matter it seemed not to be, nor ether, nor anything elseconceivable by mortal mind. What, then, but some exotic _emanation_;
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][HAUNTED HOUSE]some vampirish vapor such as Exeter rustics tell of as lurking overcertain churchyards? This I felt was the clue, and again I looked at thefloor before the fireplace where the mold and niter had taken strangeforms.In ten minutes my mind was made up, and taking my hat I set out forhome, where I bathed, ate, and gave by telephone an order for a pickax,a spade, a military gas-mask, and six carboys of sulfuric acid, all tobe delivered the next morning at the cellar door of the shunned house inBenefit Street. After that I tried to sleep; and failing, passed thehours in reading and in the composition of inane verses to counteract mymood.At eleven a. m. the next day I commenced digging. It was sunny weather,
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][SURPRISE][DANGER][HORROR]and I was glad of that. I was still alone, for as much as I feared theunknown horror I sought, there was more fear in the thought of tellinganybody. Later I told Harris only through sheer necessity, and becausehe had heard odd tales from old people which disposed him ever so littletoward belief. As I turned up the stinking black earth in front of thefireplace, my spade causing a viscous yellow ichor to ooze from thewhite fungi which it severed, I trembled at the dubious thoughts of whatI might uncover. Some secrets of inner earth are not good for mankind,
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][DANGER][SURPRISE][HORROR]and this seemed to me one of them.My hand shook perceptibly, but still I delved; after a while standing inthe large hole I had made. With the deepening of the hole, which wasabout six feet square, the evil smell increased; and I lost all doubt ofmy imminent contact with the hellish thing whose emanations had cursedthe house for over a century and a half. I wondered what it would looklike--what its form and substance would be, and how big it might havewaxed through long ages of life-sucking. At length I climbed out of the
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][SURPRISE][EMOTION][DANGER]hole and dispersed the heaped-up dirt, then arranging the great carboysof acid around and near two sides, so that when necessary I might emptythem all down the aperture in quick succession. After that I dumpedearth only along the other two sides; working more slowly and donning mygas-mask as the smell grew. I was nearly unnerved at my proximity to anameless thing at the bottom of a pit.Suddenly my spade struck something softer than earth. I shuddered, and
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][TRANSITION]made a motion as if to climb out of the hole, which was now as deep asmy neck. Then courage returned, and I scraped away more dirt in thelight of the electric torch I had provided. The surface I uncovered wasfishy and glassy--a kind of semi-putrid congealed jelly with suggestionsof translucency. I scraped further, and saw that it had form. There was
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][ACTION][SURPRISE][FLASHBACK]a rift where a part of the substance was folded over. The exposed areawas huge and roughly cylindrical; like a mammoth soft blue-whitestovepipe doubled in two, its largest part some two feet in diameter.Still more I scraped, and then abruptly I leaped out of the hole andaway from the filthy thing; frantically unstopping and tilting the heavycarboys, and precipitating their corrosive contents one after anotherdown that charnel gulf and upon the unthinkable abnormality whose titan_elbow_ I had seen.       *       *       *       *       *The blinding maelstrom of greenish-yellow vapor which surgedtempestuously up from that hole as the floods of acid descended, willnever leave my memory. All along the hill people tell of the yellow day,
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][SURPRISE][DANGER][CONFLICT][PROBLEM][FLASHBACK][HORROR]when virulent and horrible fumes arose from the factory waste dumped inthe Providence River, but I know how mistaken they are as to the source.They tell, too, of the hideous roar which at the same time came fromsome disordered water-pipe or gas main underground--but again I couldcorrect them if I dared. It was unspeakably shocking, and I do not seehow I lived through it. I did faint after emptying the fourth carboy,which I had to handle after the fumes had begun to penetrate my mask;but when I recovered I saw that the hole was emitting no fresh vapors.
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT]The two remaining carboys I emptied down without particular result, andafter a time I felt it safe to shovel the earth back into the pit. Itwas twilight before I was done, but fear had gone out of the place. Thedampness was less fetid, and all the strange fungi had withered to akind of harmless grayish powder which blew ash-like along the floor. Oneof earth's nethermost terrors had perished for ever; and if there be ahell, it had received at last the demon soul of an unhallowed thing. And
[HOWARD LOVECRAFT][EMOTION][TRANSITION][RELIEF][HAUNTED HOUSE]as I patted down the last spadeful of mold, I shed the first of the manytears with which I have paid unaffected tribute to my beloved uncle'smemory.The next spring no more pale grass and strange weeds came up in theshunned house's terraced garden, and shortly afterward Carrington Harrisrented the place. It is still spectral, but its strangeness fascinatesme, and I shall find mixed with my relief a queer regret when it is torndown to make way for a tawdry shop or vulgar apartment building. Thebarren old trees in the yard have begun to bear small, sweet apples, andlast year the birds nested in their gnarled boughs.
